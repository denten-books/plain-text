## Chapter 6: Engineering for Dissent
`parity, transparency`

Attributes ideas of autonomous technology to a Thomas, Carlyle, Charles
Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Thoreau, mark Twain,
Henry Adams, John Ruskin, William Morris, E. E. Cummings, George Orwell, Marcel
Duchamp, and Kurt Vonnegut.

"In one definition or another autonomous technology is now a significant
transdisciplinary hypothesis in the natural and social sciences, the arts,
journalism, and even the technical specialties themselves. But how can this
be" [@winner, 19].

Faustian spirit. Striving for control. "The proof of science is technology"
[@winner, 25]. What can you actually do?

Skepticism about technological agency in the face of "unintended" or "emergent"
side effects of complex systems. If fracking for natural gas contributes to the
increase of earthquakes, that does not mean that fracking somehow "has a mind"
to destroy humanity by earthquakes.

I am able to now finally confront the ghostly apparition present throughout in
the background
Much of what today goes by the term new materialism is materialism in the sense
of talking about and privileging a certain idea of object-oriented
consciousness. Some go even as far as to elevate objects to the status of
political and ethical agents, as when.

Winner has it as noncomprehensibility instead of autonamism.

Three figures: Heidegger, Marx, and Fanon.

We now reach the final and most speculative chapter of the book. Here, I can no
longer rely on strictly historical examples to make my case. So far, I have
shown that a notion of plain text is, in some real sense, engineered into the
fabric of modern computing. I have argued that our daily encounter with the
text, mediated by the screen and the keyboard, cannot and should not be
understood in mere instrumental terms. The technological system that envelops
the creation and the transmission of thought is more than an instrument or a
market. It constitutes a part of our cognitive apparatus. What are the values
that guide the development. Transparency, parity, room for dissent.

I think the author misses the point. As far as I see it, Unix tools are
optimized for one thing: the human user. If `ls` is bloated, it is only bloated
from the system point of view. As a user, I only see a small command that is
quick and consistent (to a reasonable extent) with other tools. I don't need to
know about 39 flags--that complexity is hidden for power users, and revealed
with time, as I need to accomplish more complex tasks. For now, I only use and
"see" two or three. And if more is needed, the program is small enough to be
reasonably well documented. `man ls` perhaps with `grep` is all most people
need.

This brings me to the second point. "Streams of  text." Just like `ls`, streams
of text are an optimal format/convention for humans. Many other things are
better at being more compact or more efficient etc. But as formats and
conventions proliferate, streams of plain text remain: readable and universal.
Humans will ALWAYS be able to work with text. It is something that all humans
kind of agreed upon--which cannot be said for any other formats or standards,
which can offer various technical benefits at the expense of longevity,
universality, and readability.

These two features (`ls` being relatively light and text streamy) leads to the
"bootstrapping" effects sought after by the first generation of Unix
developers. Learning about pipes and filters in one part of the system is
applicable to all others. These tools scale with your level of expertise. They
grow with you because despite the small quirks, there's a remarkable
consistency of interface: text! Consequently `ls` (along with many other core
tools) is implemented in the same way across a staggering variety of platforms.
It has survived decades of alternatives touted as "better," "faster," "more
usable," etc. etc. etc. That is the remarkable achievement of *nix / GNU etc.
approach to creating human-centric software. As we architect new and ever more
complex systems, we would do well to understand why Unix has endured, warts and
all.

Plain text is a file format optimized for a human mind. It keeps the
system available to view.

The debate over encryption erupted on Capitol Hill again Wednesday, with an FBI
official testifying that law enforcement's challenge is working with tech
companies "to build technological solutions to prevent encryption above all
else."

Impact on the study of textual artifact. If are are to take the hypothesis of
extended cognition seriously, we must treat the tools of cognitive augmentation
as seriously as we would our own mental development, in the traditional sense.

The flattening of the knowledge realm. It is not the absence of topography. It
is our ability to readily perceive topography, and to place ourselves within
that discourse. The knowledge of the mechanic vs. the knowledge of a surgeon.
The surgeon should get more money because of the subjective experience of
cutting people up. That part does not transfer. The technical literature is
actually quite understandable. Incommensurability of subjective experience.
Commensurability of knowledge. The fundamental problem of modern world is the
problem of expertise.

### Negation

James: the aesthetic function is one of negation. To create art is to sculpt
reality. Ethics is similar choice making [@james, 289].

Automonous technology. Exploring all possibilities at once. Must negate some.
That is ethics. James calls this the highest form: making choices. Where do
these choices come from? What guides development?

### 4.5 Human Revealment (Heidegger + Conclusion)


It is tempting to think that alienation come from phase one. Human displacement
from the hand. Some notion of analog as natural and digital as artificial

The belief that the organic is the chief criterion of what is authentic in art
and life continues, it need hardly be said, to have great force with us, the
more as we become alarmed by the deterioration of the organic environment
[trilling].

The passage between thought and its physical manifestation, whether
intra-cranial, as a configuration of neurons and synapses, or external, as a
note to self or a novel, is an unsolved problem in science. Like the gap
between mind and brain, the distance between thought and text has not yet been
bridged.

What happened to our writing implements? First came the typewriter and
philosophers thought it would ruin humanity. Then, with the computer, software
engineers thought they saw a glimpse of textuality capable of transcendence.
Then came Microsoft Word. And worse yet, the box: the ubiquitous internet
browser text box that just does very little. Ctrl-Copy, Cntrl-Paste.

What is a well-formed thought? Is being able to communicate one's reasoning
clearly an integral part of clear reasoning? Can one think well, but write
poorly? Or does thinking well in a sense also mean writing well? I don't mean
to ask these questions to start an argument about cognition or rhetoric.
Rather, I would appeal to the intuitive sense of connection between the written
and the mental worlds and to simply note the natural correspondence between the
two. There is a bit of magic in that correspondence—the kind of magic that
becomes transparent (and disappears from view) through acclimation. Here is a
simple to-do list from my partner. For some moments after reading it, her will
has become my command. My arms and legs move under the spell of her bidding.
For her part, she has ensured that the list reflects what she wants me to do.
That is, it reflects what she wants. And in her absence, the to-do list did
represent her volition accurately. I read it as a testament to her will; I was
able to internalize the instructions; and then I acted on their behalf. We may
say that the to-do list was used to synchronize an aspect of our mental lives.
It was an interface of sorts, which has allowed us to bridge two separate
mental worlds, mediated by a piece of paper. And yet how quickly we discard it!
The interface itself is perhaps too thin and transparent to hold our (critical)
attention.

An interface is literally a point of contact. The elevator button, for example,
is a quintessential interface between you and the mechanism of the elevator.
The button allows the will of the operator to become one with the action of the
machine. It is an interface designed to accept human input. But, from the
elevator's point of view, the human finger is the interface to the human. In
the combined operation of human and elevator it is thus difficult to pinpoint
the exact physical boundaries of the contact. The interface is paper-thin, we
may say—it happens when a thing slides into the other, and for a moment both
become one: a shared physiology and a shared intentional apparatus. We could
say that our to-do list is a point of contact between two people. But before
being that, it was a point of contact between a person, a piece of paper, and
writing. For the purposes of this dissertation, a literary interface is a
specialized point of contact between the mental, the symbolic, and the
technological modes of being.

Let's examine the piece of paper more closely. A literary interface is first
and foremost mediated by language. But language alone is not enough to
constitute even a simple to-do list. We must also have writing—a way to record
language for later recall or further dissemination. The to-do list also
requires a pen and a piece of paper or any transferrable storage medium. I
therefore insist on "literary" and not merely "textual" or "linguistic"
interfaces, because my concern here is not with any individual text or
utterance, but already with a system of such recorded texts or utterances—a
physical, artifactual system, which encompasses a range of possible activities.
These may include the ability to read and to write, but also to select,
highlight, underline, format, annotate, review, redact, skim, commit to memory,
store, archive, retrieve, search, borrow, lend, tag, comment, ruffle through
the pages, digest, process (as in word processing), type, scribble, click,
zoom, drag, drop, cut, and paste. It is this system as a whole that I propose
to designate as "literary" (and this in contrary to some more specialized
definitions of the same).

A literary interface is secondly an artifact of mental (cognitive) activity. To
my mind, a text, like the to-do list for example, is always a privileged
symbolic representation. I say this because I think it, and because what I
write can be said to represent the state of my mind. Or at least I want it to
represent accurately the state of my mind. Even if I wanted to deceive you as
to the state of my mind, the deception would at least represent my desire to
deceive (we will deal with truly un-intentional texts also in the scope of the
dissertation). A text is a snapshot of sorts, which captures a fleeting moment
from the stream of private, internal, and generally invisible mental events in
the shape of a symbolic (representational), but nevertheless tangible,
material, externalized and therefore visible artifacts. By contrast, spoken
language is never fully externalized. At the exact moment of utterance my
speech is still a part of my body. It is inside of me literally: on its way
out, but still inside, near the tongue and the palate, still contained within
my larynx. But in typing these words (rather than merely speaking them) I
intend to spend much effort to enforce the congruity between what I think and
what you read, asynchronously, through the intermediacy of language, text, and
word-processing software (in my case). That intermediacy between the mental and
the written is a part of the interface, in a way that the "interface between
science and the humanities" may signify a common boundary between two distinct
disciplines. The literary interface is privileged not just because it encodes
an aspect of one's mental world, but because in the moment of contact, it is an
aspect of that mental world. And for that moment, it is as dear to me as a toe
or a finger, or perhaps as a dream or a recollection.

And finally, a literary interface is a material artifact. By this I mean that
something like a pen, paper, a computer screen, or a keyboard is involved in
the practice of using literary interfaces. Just like an elevator button,
literary interfaces are physical objects. They come into being through usage,
and make no sense as discrete objects, as in the case of the elevator control
panel removed from the passenger and the mechanism of the elevator. Or rather,
I should say that elevator buttons make no sense removed from the action of
pressing buttons and transporting things and people between floors. An
interface is a kind of a verbalized noun—its understanding must come not just
in the examining the artifact, but in examining the artifact in action. Only in
action can we observe the momentary unity between the literary, the cognitive,
and the artifactual.

"A text editor is often the primary interface between a user and the system,
and the program with which most user time is spent. Accordingly, an editor has
to be easy to use, and efficient of the user's time---editing commands have to
'flow off the fingertips.'" [@kernighan_unix_1978, 2117].

Southall. Interfaces between the designer and the document

It may seem at first a bit odd to put the words "style" and "cognition" in the
same sentence, but the concept of "cognitive style" is well-articulated in the
scientific literature on the psychology of personality. The idea of cognitive
stylistics was developed first by the American followers of Carl Jung, who like
Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers (of the still
ubiquitous Myers-Briggs Type Indicator offered by career placement centers
across the country) were interested in applying insights from
quantitatively-based psychological observation (psychometrics) to problems of
labor and education. In the early 1950s, the idea of "personality type" gave
way to "cognitive style" in the work of psychologists George Klein, Philip
Holzman, Riley Gardner, and Herbert Schlesinger.1 For this new generation of
scholars, the concept meant something like "the individual differences in
adaptive modes of organizing and experiencing the stimulus world."2 That is to
say that people simply have or develop a preference for a particular mode of
thinking about and perceiving the world. Or even simpler: "everyone does it in
his own way."3 Thus, in an early experiment Gardner observes a group of people
categorizing objects by size, shape, and color. Predictably, different people
perceive the differences between size, shape, and color in differing
gradations.4 The converse of this experiment suggests also that certain modes
of material organization favor a particular style of thought. We may assume,
for example, that certain ways of organizing the world attract or "make sense"
to a particular type of person. In the literature on education, the concept is
therefore popular within the discussion of learning styles, by which teachers
are encouraged to present their material in ways accessible to students with
varying preferences for visual, auditory, tactile, or kinesthetic learning.

The hypothesis of cognitive styles underlies a particular belief about the
connection between mental organization and the organization of objects in the
real world. It is what Heidegger called "the correlation between being, word,
gathering, hand, and writing"5 and perhaps what Nietzsche meant when he wrote
that "our writing tools are also working on our thoughts."6 Heidegger in
particular is often cited in this regard. In his meditation on Parmenides,
delivered as a series of lectures during the war at the University of Freiburg,
Heidegger is clearly bothered by what he perceives as the "irruption of the
typewriter into the realm of the world of handwriting."7 Ever in search of
essences, he imagines hand-writing to possess a special kind of magic, denoting
"an original essential nexus, to which the indicating writing-hand belongs." He
continues to say that: [...] in handwriting the relation of Being to man,
namely the word, is inscribed in beings themselves. The origin and the way of
dealing with writing is already in itself a decision about the relation of
Being and of the word to man and consequently a decision about the comportment
of man to beings and about the way both, man and thing, stand in
unconcealedness or are withdrawn from it.8

The typewriter somehow disturbs this idyllic picture, withdrawing "from man the
essential rank of the hand, without man's experiencing this withdrawal
appropriately and recognizing that it has transformed the relation of Being to
his essence."9 In my favorite bit of condescension from the old master,
Heidegger goes as far as to suggest that his readers misunderstand him
precisely because type-setting is so groundless. "The typewriter is a signless
cloud," he writes, "a withdrawing concealment in the midst of its very
obtrusiveness […] not showing itself to its essence." "Perhaps that is why most
of you, as is proven to me by your reaction, though well-intended, have not
grasped what I have been trying to say."10

What is Heidegger trying to say here? And what precisely is being concealed by
the typewriter? In "The Question Concerning Technology," originally published
in 1954, Heidegger explains that technology is primarily a mode of revealing
truth. To make this point, Heidegger begins with an analysis of a specific
artifact—a silver chalice used for ceremonial rights. Initially, it seems that
the primary purpose of the artifact is to facilitate something, the
administration of ceremonial rites in this case. The cup is an instrument for
something, in other words; it is a means to an end. Another way to put it would
be to say that the ceremony is the cause for the cup's very existence. But
there is more than just causa finalis, as Heidegger puts it. The physical
properties of silver (causa materialis) also constitute a cause, as does the
shape of the cup (causa formalis), and as does the silversmith who has
fashioned the vessel (the silversmith being causa efficiens). In fact the cup's
very instrumentality is grounded in this chain of causation. The cup is an
occasion to bring forth the ceremony; to bring forth a certain property of
silver; to bring forth the water-containing property of the vessel's shape; and
finally to bring forth the craft of the silversmith. The making of the cup is
not mere "handicraft manufacture," Heidegger writes, nor is it "only artistic
and poetical bringing into appearance and concrete imagery," but rather a
"bringing-forth, "poiesis in the highest sense."11

At its best, technology reveals truth. At this point of the essay Heidegger
makes a distinction between traditional technology or "handicraft," and modern,
machine-powered technology.12 Modern technology also reveals, writes Heidegger.
But it does not "unfold into a bringing-forth in the sense of poiesis." Rather
modern technology is a challenge or a provocation [Herausfordern] to nature.
The figure of the natural betrays the extent of Heidegger's romanticism. "The
revealing that is modern technology is a challenging, which puts to nature the
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as
such," writes Heidegger.13 "But does it hold true for the old windmill as
well?" he asks. And answers, No. Its sails do indeed turn in the wind; they are
left entirely to the wind's blowing. But the windmill does not unlock energy
from the air currents in order to store it. In contrast, a tract of land is
challenged in the hauling out of coal and ore. The earth now reveals itself as
a coal mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit. The field that the
peasant formerly cultivated and set in order appears different from how it did
when to set it in order still meant to take care of and to maintain. The work
of the peasant does not challenge the soil of the field. In sowing grain he
places seed in the keeping of the forces of growth and waits over its increase.
[By contrast] agriculture is now the mechanized food industry. Air is now set
upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield uranium, for
example; uranium set upon to yield atomic energy, which can be released either
for destruction or for peaceful use.14

The passage is remarkable for its apparent prescience of the contemporary
environmental conservation movement, which often implies a similar conservative
romanticism about handicraft technology. Both ideologies contain a particular
notion of "authentic" or "unadulterated" state of nature, which is
"challenged," to use Heidegger's terminology, by the tools of modern
technology. Handicraft, by contrast, is seen as an activity that operates in
harmony with nature, without undue disturbance. This view is of course
historically incorrect. Pre-modern hunting practices and agriculture have often
led to large-scale ecological disturbances: pollution, species extinction, and
deforestation. In this context, the distinction between modern and pre-modern
itself begins to seem arbitrary. The latent romantic naturalism strains under
further scrutiny. The silver chalice, for example, can be seen as the
culmination of a long and destructive process of mining, ore processing,
smelting, and manufacture, which at each stage involves the very opposite of
Heidegger's ideal non-disruptive poiesis.

A more chartable reading of the passage would attempt to place Heidegger's
critique of modern technology in the context of his phenomenology. Heidegger's
phenomenology is a weighty, but well-explored topic, and for this reason I will
limit our discussion to its most generally-known and relevant features. For
Heidegger, our knowledge of the world comes in two flavors: presentness-at-hand
[Vorhandenheit] and readiness-to-hand [Zuhandenheit]. When we think of some
object in the world—a hammer, to use the famous example—we first imagine
something like the formal definition of a hammer in a series of knowable facts
about the object: a hammer is made of metal and wood, we use it to pound nails,
it is man's first tool, and so on. The type of epistemological knowledge about
the world, the knowledge that combines the readily observable properties and
our shared understanding of the object, is called "present-to-hand" in
Heidegger's system. "Ready-to-hand" knowledge by contrast is practical. I know
something about the hammer, but I also have used a hammer—and in using it I
understood the tool in an applied manner. But more than that, in using the
hammer I understand something about the nail. An essential property of the
transition between theoretical and applied knowledge of the world, is the
disappearance of the tool. For Heidegger, the tool literally becomes a kind of
"sight," helping us identify properties of the world that are particularly
well-suited for its application. "Action has its own kind of sight," Heidegger
writes in Being and Time.15 The hammer helps us experience the nail in a
hammering kind-of-a-way. Hammering reveals something about the nail, and by
extension, about metals in general. At the bottom of this experience is man's
relationship to nature itself. All "good" technologies work in that way for
Heidegger. "Technology comes to presence in the realm where revealing an
unconcealment take place, where aletheia, truth, happens," he writes in "The
Question Concerning Technology."16 The plow reveals something about the earth,
just as the windmill reveals something about the air current.

Modern technology reveals too, but it breaks the "natural" phenomenological
experience in two important ways. First, the tool fails to fully disappear into
the experience. I imagine this to be the same kind of a feeling a musician has
when playing an unfamiliar instrument. The instrument "stands in the way" of
the unity between man and music. Second, the modern instrument introduces a
kind of a perceptual bias. It treats nature as a reserve of energy [Bestand]—as
a kind of a storehouse, an inventory, or a collection. Whereas the farmer's
plow reveals the earth as fertile ground, the tractor reveals it to be a mere
resource for mechanized agriculture. The earth ceases to be an object of
knowledge, amenable to other ways of knowing. In this way, modern technology
works to "order" or to "enframe" matter, interfering with the very process of
truth-formation. Moreover, just as the earth ceases to be the object of
knowledge, the ordering—or to use the very un-Heideggerian term, the
commodification—of natural resources threatens to turn the human into a
resource. For Heidegger, modern technology disrupts the status of the human as
a proper subject:

Only to the extent that man for his part is already challenged to exploit the
energies of nature can this revealing which orders happen. If man is
challenged, ordered, to do this, then does not man himself belong even more
originally than nature within the standing–reserve? The current talk about
human resources, about the supply of patients for a clinic, gives evidence of
this. The forester who measures the felled timber in the woods and who to all
appearances walks the forest path in the same way his grandfather did, is today
ordered by the industry that produces commercial woods, whether he knows it or
not. He is made subordinate to the orderability of cellulose, which for its
part challenged forth by the need of paper, which is then delivered to
newspapers and illustrated magazines.

The commodification of both subject and object commodifies phenomenology
itself. One can perceive more than a hint of Marx in this line of critique.  If
the plow reveals something about the earth, the pen reveals something about
language. The relationship between man and language is of a primary importance
to Heidegger. In the realm of language, man stands in relation to being itself.
Heidegger's own discourse often progresses through a series of etymological
reconstructions, which contain an almost mystical sense of reverence for the
veracity of meaning contained in the original, Greek understanding of a given
concept. By similar logic, the hand represents a "pure," unadulterated
relationship of man to language. The hand "contains an essence of the human
being because the word, as the essential region of the hand, is the essential
ground of being human."17 In the metaphoric juxtaposition between word and
ground, the analogy between pen and plow becomes apparent. And just like
mechanized agriculture, mechanized writing "deprives the hand of dignity in the
realm of the written word and degrades the word to a mere means for the traffic
of communication."18 The typewriter commodifies language in other words,
turning it into the "standing reserve" of information. "In mechanized writing
all humans begin to look the same," writes Heidegger.19 Intermedia as
Syncopation between Human, Machine, and Language It has been suggested that
Heidegger's distaste for mechanized writing stemmed from his inability to
type.20 Don Ihde, a contemporary authority on Heidegger's philosophy of
technology, suggests that all new mechanisms go through an awkward stage of
sorts, in which they still feel unfamiliar to us, and therefore disruptive in
the way an unfamiliar instrument is "in the way" of music for a musician. But
with time, these technologies once again become transparent to us, and the link
between man and language is once again restored in the fluent hands of a nimble
typist.21 Such an attempt to "de-romanticize"22 Heidegger's argument cannot
fully diffuse the rhetorical force of his critique. Heidegger's romanticism
continues to exert considerable influence on contemporary thought, particularly
when it comes to the discussion about emerging technology, and especially in
the fields of literary and cultural studies. Perhaps the most visible (in a
sense of well-known and often-cited) example of this trend is Friedrich
Kittler's 1986 Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. In the conclusion of this
book-length study, Kittler brings the Heideggerian rhetoric to its natural
paranoiac crescendo: "A simple feed-back loop—and information machines bypass
humans—their so-called inventors […] Electronics, a tube monster since
Bletchley Park, replaces discourse, and programmability replaces free will […]
Under the condition of high technology, literature has nothing more to say. It
ends in cryptograms that defy interpretation and only permit interception." As
evidence for this vision, Kittler submits a letter/poem which resembles a
nonsensically-encoded communiqué addressed to Truman, Roosevelt, Stalin, and
Churchill.23 A more tempered position, along the same Heideggerian lines, was
advanced by Erich Kahler, a prominent American literary critic writing in the
1960s, who saw the history of the avant-garde movements in the 20th century
following a downward trajectory of formal disintegration—from the initial
purging of sentiment in the nouveau roman, to the dissolution of language in
the final "typographical stage" of literary development.24 Kahler's ultimate
worry was over what he called "the triumph of incoherence," which leads to "the
dissolution of the linguistic form," "the divorce of language from its human
source," and finally, to the destruction of consciousness itself (when
consciousness for him is defined as coherent perception of the world25). "What
started as poetry," writes Kahler, "ends up in typography."26 "Under the
fanfares of thrilling innovations sounding everywhere, from Brazil to Iceland,
literature fades away, not only into graphics, but into motley sound
associations and mechanistic regimentation:" The overwhelming preponderance of
collectivity with its scientific, technological and economic machinery, the
daily flow of new discoveries and inventions that perpetually change aspects
and habits of thought and practice, the increasing incapacity of individual
consciousness to cope with the abstract anarchy of its environment, and its
surrender to a collective consciousness that operates anonymously and diffusely
in our social and intellectual institutions—all this has shifted the center of
gravity of our world from existential to functional, instrumental, and
mechanical ways of life. At the same time the hypertrophy of functional
rationalization has produced an overcompensating irrationality, reversing to
the bodily concrete or spiraling to the absurd. Hence the products of the
avant-gardes display a strange blend of erratic imaginative vagaries with
technological and pseudo-scientific aspirations. Fragments of unconscious and
sensory experience are in a ghostly manner treated with an exactitude derived
from the rational consciousness and information.27 

I take Kahler's reaction to concrete poetry as an eloquent, if somewhat
misguided, expansion of Heidegger's "typewriters are ruining things" thesis.
The argument is again a restatement of the connection between technology,
language, and consciousness—a triad that resurfaces every few decades as a
manifestation of our collective technophobic hypochondria.

In my understanding, the practice of concrete poetry stands in diametric
opposition to the thesis advanced by Heidegger, Kittler, and Kahler—a vision of
literary dissolution under the conditions of high technology. The artifice of
Emmett Williams's "Sometimes" (Figure 4.1) lies in the reinserting of the
writing implement into the protected world of the poetic. The poem is
impossible without the machine. Reading or reciting it is not enough: we are
meant to type, or at least to imagine typing the poem. Classical scansion is
not sufficient either. We must be able to imagine the rhythm of the typewriter:
the sharp hammer-like movement of its type-bars, the clicking of the platern,
the whizzing sound and the bell of the lever-operated carriage return. The
typewriter "thinks" in so far as it suggests a particular style—of writing,
thinking—a style that has an impetus, a logic, and a poetry of its own. The
rhythmic impetus of the typewriter pulls the poem along a particular metric
trajectory. The poet disrupts that logic with a correction. The resulting
grapheme, documents the interruption, and in the process pulls the material
world into the literary. The smudge of the ribbon, the rejected versions of the
poem, the mark of the proofreader, and yes the typewriter itself—all of these
"extra-literary" elements of the creative process are elevated to the status of
the poetic. Another way to describe the dynamic between literature and
technology in this case, would be to say that the concretist aesthetic
appropriates the extra-functional elements of the writing mechanism. What
initially seems a mere artifact of literary production becomes art. Literature
thus taints technology, stripping away the pretense of pure functionalism.
Under the condition of the literary, to reverse Kittler here, technology gains
a new voice. Nothing is determined about the encounter between human, machine,
and language. Each element of this triad contains a mere suggestion of rhythm
and pace. The resulting symphony is a syncopation of all three elements. There
is of course nothing particularly modern about his dynamic. The printing press
introduced a particular poetics into the language as well. It is just that
after a time, the cognitive style of the printing press has become transparent
to us, particularly after publishing had congealed into a relatively stable
system of production and distribution. The advent of the typewriter, of desktop
publishing, and of distributed, online models of publication destabilizes the
established stylistics. With each of these advancements we worry anew about the
impact of technology on our way of thinking—a concern that goes back to the
introduction of writing itself, as in Plato's Phaedrus.

The history of concrete poetry can be seen as the culmination of one such
shift, spurred on by the transference of type-setting from the printer to the
author. This dynamic may explain the simultaneous eruption of concrete poetry
across multiple literary traditions. "The confused geography of its beginnings
reflects the universality of its roots," Williams writes.28 He then suggests
the following signposts upon this landscape: the "constellation" poetry of
Eugene Gomerenger; the posters of Carlo Belloli and F.T. Marinetti; the
Noigandres poets of Sao Paulo; the work of the Danish poet Oyvin Fahlstrom; the
ideagrams of Dieter Roth; the sound-poetry experiments of the East German poet
Carlfriedrich Claus; the collaborative work of the Vienna composer Gerhard
Ruhm, architecht Friedrich Achleitner, a jazz musician Oswald Weiner, and the
poets H.C. Atmann and Konrad Bayer in the early fifties; and finally Williams's
own work with the Darmstadt Circle, which included the Kitasano Katue of Japan
and the German dramaturgist Claus Bremer.29 To this topography we could add an
increasingly long list of "intermedial" work by Vladimir Mayakovsky and
Guillame Apollinaire in the early 1920s, several of Lewis Carroll's poetic
experiments, and much work from non-western traditions, in alphabets that have
always contained a strong visual element (Chinese, Arabic, etc).  In this
light, concrete poetry can be seen as the culmination of a particular
techno-cognitive style—a full-blown artistic movement which peaks at the
eclipse of the typewriter age. The cognitive style of concrete poetry, if one
may speak of such a thing, is one of cross-modal perception. It literally
attempts to engage areas of the brain not normally affected by passive reading.
Artists associated with Fluxus and concrete poetry were committed to the
development of what they called intermedia. In his 1966 "Statement on
Intermedia," Dick Higgins, the Cambridge-born poet, composer, and publisher,
writes: For the last ten years or so, artists have changed their media to suit
this situation, to the point where the media have broken down in their
traditional forms, and have become merely puristic points of reference. The
idea has arisen, as if by spontaneous combustion throughout the entire world,
that these points are arbitrary and only useful as critical tools, in saying
that such-and-such a work is basically musical, but also poetry. This is the
intermedial [sic] approach, to emphasize the dialectic between the media. A
composer is a dead man unless he composes for all the media and for his
world.30 The spontaneous invention of this artistic program in Switzerland,
Italy, Argentina, Germany, and the United States31 is contemporaneous with the
turn to cross-modal perception studies in post-war psychology. At the core of
this shared program is a new understanding of cognitive stylistics. As Marshal
McLuhan, himself associated with the Fluxus movement, wrote in his 1967
Verbi-Voco-Visual Explorations, "the physics of typographic lineality have
dominated our perception."32 But, as Kahler notes in his anti-concretist
polemic, this approach has also erased the boundaries between the
socially-constructed categories that separate the literary from the visual and
auditory arts. With that expansion come the loss of specificity and the
dissolution of the protective barriers that usually separate genre and medium.
Fluxus could thus be viewed as a type of cognitive calisthenics, designed to
loosen the rigidity of fixed mental perception—a mental rigidity reinforced by
the rigidity in cultural categories (epistemology).

### 4.5 Short, Swift, and Secret (Steno)

stenography Engelbart's dreams.

Transcription of speech was a major concern for the various stenographic
movements in the English-speaking world, which go back the publication of
Timothy Bright's Characterie: An Arte of Shorte, Swifte Secrete Writing by
Character in 1588. In the introduction to this slim volume, Bright writes that
his work was inspired by the "speedie kind of writing by character" mentioned
first in Plutarch's Life of Cato the Younger, improved upon by Seneca, and then
lost to history.1 

"The uses and diuers: short, that a swifte hande may therewith write orations
or publike actions of speach, uttered as becometh the grauitie of such actions,
verbatim. Secrete, as no kinde of wryting like, and herein (besides other
properties) excelling the wryting by letters, and alphabet, in that, nations of
strange languages, may hereby communicate their meaning together in writing,
through of sundrie tongues, it is reported of the of the people of China, that
they have no other kinde, and so traffike together many Prouinces of that
kingdom, ignorant one of an others speach. Their characters are very long, and
harde to make, that a dousen of mine, may be written and soone as one of
theirs; besides, they wanting an alphabet, fal into an infinite number, which
is a thing that greatlie chargeth memory, and may discourage the learner.2

The task of stenography then, from its early modern inception was first to
bring handwriting closer to the speed of speech, and second, to imagine a
universal alphabet that could be used by speakers of all languages and
dialects. In modern terms, we might say that stenography was concerned first
and foremost with our ability to cope with an increasing amount of information,
and second with the international standardization of character encoding (that
is, with the universal transmission of information). In The Elements of
Tachygraphy, first published in 1869, David Philips Lindsley writes: Though we
depend upon facilities to aid in mental and moral advancement, as much as in
physical, yet we have been slow to apply to the mental and moral elevation of
the race the principles that have enabled us to develop our material resources.
Inventions to aid in the commerce of ideas are no less essential than those
which we have realized in the interchange of coarser commodities. The art of
writing was the original lever by which the race was at first raised above
barbarism. Successive improvements in this art have marked the epochs of the
greatest mental activity.3

In this program we thus see the birth of the intellect augmentation movement of
the mid-twentieth century. The contemporary Unicode universal character
encoding standard, used for the representation of text for computer processing
is the natural development of this program. The unicode.org website mirrors
Bright's Characterie in defining Unicode as "a consistent way of encoding
multilingual plain text," which "brings order to a chaotic state of affairs
that has made it difficult to exchange text files internationally."4

By the late 19th century stenography existed as a full-blown international
movement concerned with universal spelling reform. John Westby-Gibson's The
Bibliography of Shorthand contains no fewer than twenty volumes on the subject
in the first half of the 17th century, thirty-six titles in the second half,
fifty-six titles in the 18th century, and more than four thousand entries for
the 19th century. This publishing activity was supported by the proliferation
of stenographic societies across France, Germany, England, and the United
States—many of these with regional chapters and publication organs.
Westby-Gibson himself was editor of Shorthand; President of The Shorthand
Society from 1886 to 18887; honorary member of the Shorthand Writers'
association, London Branch; honorary member of the Manchester Shorthand
Writers' Association; honorary Secretary and founder of the International
Shorthand Congress, 1887; and finally, Chairman-elect of the Historical and
Literary Section of the International Shorthand Congress.5 The meetings of
these societies were often accompanied by public speeches and poem recitations,
dully taken down by the stenographers in attendance. The 1843 issue of the
Phonotypic Journal, supported by Isaac Pitman's Phonographic Institution
contains the following several poems from the Nottingham and the Birmingham
Phonetic Festivals: From the proceedings of the

The stenographers of the 19th century understood their movement as the kind of
a global phenomenon that approximates our contemporary understanding of the
internet and social networking. Again Lindsley from The Elements of
Tachygraphy: When Tachygraphy shall be generally known and used, an electric
thrill of life will run through our communities, awakening new sympathies, and
forming bonds of union long dissevered. What railroads have done in bringing
friends together that could otherwise never interchange a visit during a
lifetime, brief writing will do, in bringing minds together that would, without
it, communicate with too much difficulty to be able to continue the
acquaintance begun in youth; and aid in extending that more valuable
interchange of thought among those of similar tastes, which tends both to the
perfection of our knowledge of science, and its general diffusion.6

In this project stenography and typewriting technologies compete for the same
vision of augmenting the natural human facilities of information processing and
knowledge dissemination.7 Stenography is understood here as a thoroughly modern
and modernizing technology that does for the mental and moral development what
the steam engine and areal flight did for the material realm.

IBM Format

By 1932 the ITU documents list two new standards, International Telegraphic
Alphabet No. 1 (ITA-1) and International Telegraphic Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2).
The ITA formats, like the Baudot, represented latin characthers in a system of
fixed-lenght "bit" codes, For example, in ITA-1 the letter "A" and the number
"1" are both represented by `-++++`; "X" and "," by `+-++-`, and the "error"
code by `+++--` [@itu_telegraph_1932, 34]. Because the devices are not
synchronized, the pause between each transmitted character can vary in length.
For this reason ITA-2 includes two extra bits for indicating "start" and stop"
elements. The letter "A" and a hyphen in ITA-2 would be encoded as `0110001`,
where ones and zeros represent the absence and the presence of
current[@itu_telegraph_1932, 36].

States and globally.

A text is a special type of a gun. It can be reduced to textual description,
transmitted, and manufactured cheaply. As the pendulum of textual scholarship
swings back from treating text as pure idea, the materialists must acknowledge
the aberrant specificity of textual material. Text routinely separates from its
physical medium. The ability to change form is what gives it the ability to act
at a distance.

I can only begin to work of re-inscribing the A more careful analysis of
"microscopically written inscriptions" [@kittler_there_1995] in the in the
passage between typewriters and personal computers, reveals plenty of space for
human agency. Media determine our situation only to the extent that we continue
to treat the everyday transformation of thought into pixel (and thereto into
literary control systems that structure human experience) as mystical and
mystifying black-box mechanism.

Derrida calls Marx "first thinkers of technics, or even, by far and from afar,
of the tele-technology [@derrida_specters_2006, 213].

Let me make my intentions visa vis Marx perfectly clear. I have no interest in
mobilizing the entire weight of Marxist critique. A whole subset of Marxist
terminology (dictatorship, proletariat, capital) falls outside of my purview
here. Rather, I would like to co-opt Marx's discussion on the fetishism of
commodities and import it, wholesale, to the conversation on algorithms. My
interest lies in the humanism of Marx, whose thought, despite being perpetually
out of time, continues to surprise with penetrating insight.

"All these software mutations and 'new species' of software techniques are
social in a sense that they don't simply come from individual minds or from
some 'essential' properties of a digital computer or network. They come from
software developed by groups of people and marketed to large number of
users"[@manovich_there_2011, 272-273].

"An [algorithm] is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it the
social character of men's [agreements] appears to them as an objective
character stamped upon the product of those [agreements]." "There it is a
definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the
fantastic form of a relation between things." "The relations connecting the
[agreements] of one individual with that of the rest appear, not as direct
social relations between individuals at work, but as what they really are,
material relations between person and social relations between things."
[@marx_marx-engels_1978, 321] "These quantities vary continually, independently
of the will, foresight and action of the producers.  To them, their own social
action takes the form of the action of objects, which rule the producers
instead of being ruled by them." To strip the "mystical veil," algorithms as

Derrida "If one follows the letter of the text, the critique of the ghost or of
spirits would thus be the critique of a subjective representation and an
abstraction, of what happens in the head, of what comes only out of the head,

out of the head, and survives outside the head" [@derrida_specters_2006, 215].

### 6.2 Cryptography and Steganography

Hobbes on secret knowledge (p43-44!)

Where cryptography is the art of secret communication, steganography is the art
of hiding the secret. "The purpose of steganography is to hide the very
presence of communication by embedding messages into innocuous-looking objects,
such as digital images," Jessica Fridrich and her colleagues write for the
proceedings of the Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers,
appropriately shortened to SPIE [@fridrich_searching_2004].

The real danger comes not from a metaphysical source, but from the superficial
similarity of print and pixel. Where the pen or the typewriter inscribe the
image directly into their paper medium, digital type passes through a series of
transformations between the keystroke and its corresponding pulse of the
cathode ray, or in the flow of liquid crystal. Secrecy and surveillance
technologies that rightly worry Kittler exist in the gap between text as medium
and text as content. They threaten literature (the something to be said) only
in so far as the mechanisms of literary production (how it is said) remain
hidden from the critical view. When the veil is lifted, we can begin to reclaim
the passage of textuality. In this process, technology remains a relatively
neutral conduit, enabling liberation and oppression alike. The physical control
of expression cannot and should not be reduced to something as seemingly
self-contingent as "the conditions of high technology." Systems of control
naturally obscure the pathways of agency. Letting go of agency as a critical
concept plays into the hand of those (human agents) that benefit directly from
the illusion of disempowerment. I view "control" in that sense not as an
ideology, but as the ability to physically alter the material conditions of
literary production, dissemination, and consumption. The transition from
mechanical typewriter to electrical word processor precisely couples code as
content and code as control.  ### 7.1 ITU

Related to secrecy.  Plain language and Secret language (telegraph regulations

or more of the languages authorized for international telegraph correspondence,
each word and each expression having the meaning normally assigned to it in the
language to which it belongs" [@itu_telegraph_1932, 12]. "Code language is
composed either of artificial words, or of real words not used in the meaning
normally assigned to them in the language to which they belong and consequently
not forming intelligeble phrases" [@itu_telegraph_1932, 12].

the military industrial complex. That complicity manifests itself in a shared

to help up archive and store information. Condemn the poets for using metaphors
because these are also used in advertising. Something perverse about that: it
is as if we would worry about knowledge because knowledge is used for
mechanisms of control.

Deeper metaphysical dread about computation, that should be understood

Yet, to make the subjective experience strange again is to look at it through

untranslated passage):

of the world, strange eyes; I am possessed by another. There is no integrity of

of thought, feeling, the external image of the soul. It is not I who looks out

### 6.6 Engelbart

Engelbart's lab adopted a conspicuously recursive methodology they called
"bootstrapping," by which research into creating better research was done by
enabling research [@engelbart_research_1968, 395]. Elsewhere, Engelbart
explains bootstrapping "as a process wherein the results of a given effort are
fed back into the activity in a reinforcing way, so that less internal energy
is required to achieve bigger results faster." In that light, the production of
the technical report quoted here was not an activity incidental and secondary
to research, but was the stated object of research itself.

execution brings a larger program, such as an operating system or its loader,

### 5.1 Copy Machine

We often think of literary works as completed products. *To the Lighthouse,*
*Hamlet,* *Moby Dick* seem to circulate as complete, fixed entities. Textual
critics, in charge of creating a work out of a multiplicity of texts, remind us
that the work is a carefully-crafted illusion. The text multiplies, always
threatening to undermine the unity of the work. Think of something substantial
you have written recently: a paper or a proposal perhaps.

"Computer assisted tracing of text evolution"

Goodman's "Art and Authenticity." Benjamin. Immanence and transcendence.
Goodman: thinking about the perfect copy. But there is a confusion here: fake
art is not necessarily about a copy, it is about provenance. Autographic vs.
allographic art. Whether forgery is possible. Digital vs. analog art. Analog
art is medium bound. Digital abstracts from the material.

Duplicates in Computer Science. Almost 30% of webpages are "very similar to
other pages" [@fetterly_evolution_2003].

It is a commonplace sentiment now that the printing press brought with it the
Protestant Reformation [@dittmar_information_2011, @febvre_coming_2010,
@mcluhan_gutenberg_1962, @eisenberg_word_1992]. Movable type is responsible for
at least a part of that story. The mechanization of print is what turned
writing from an autographic into a supremely allographic art. The Gutenberg
press helped place a copy of the bible into the hands of every ordinary
believer. That meant also minimizing the role of the priest as a privileged
interpreter. Without books in hand Martin Luther could not have written "all
who are in the church are priests" [@hillerbrand_protestant_2009]. Movable type
lifted text from rarefied media of parchment into that of the reified and
disposable leaflet. But until well into the middle of the 20th century, the
printing press remained in the realm of big technology: expensive, centralized,
unwieldy, and relatively easy to suppress. The liberatory potential of media
independence comes into its full fruition after the age of the typewriter.
After a historically brief flowering in the wild, our daily textual practice is
once again in danger of returning to controlled, media-bound, and
tightly-regulated conditions of existence.

Several important developments in the twentieth century aided in the liberation
of text from its material contexts. The first is the copy machine.  It is an
entirely unglamorous job to ponder the phenomenology of reading from the point
of view of a photocopier. Yet the impact of the humble Ditto and Xerox machines
has only recently began to get the scholarly attention it deserves. In the
United States, the copy machine placed a smaller version of Gutenberg press
into every office. And it allowed for the flourishing of a vibrant samizdat
(self-publishing) scene, usually connected to underground culture movements
without access to conventional publishing: punks, skinheads, computer- and
game- geeks, feminists, fans of science fiction and queer-core music
[@klanten_behind_2011, @piepmeier_girl_2009, @duncombe_notes_2008].

The word "xerox" firmly entered the English lexicon by the
mid-1960s[^ln11-xerox] along with stencil duplicators, mimeograph machines,
microfiche, spirit duplicators,[^ln11-spirit] hectographs, and dot-matrix
printing. A whole industry of photocopying still exists to seamlessly peel the
content away from one material medium and plaster it into another.

From the "point of view" of a photocopier, the text exists only as pure form.
The electro-photographic process at the basis of modern photocopying (invented
in the 1930s, but with patents dating back to the middle of the 19th century)
describes documents in terms of "electric charge patterns," "photoemissive
layers," and "sheet surfaces"  [@carlson_electron_1940,
@carlson_electrophotography_1942, @carlson_graphic_1953]. The photocopier is a
device for total graphesis and extreme surface reading.[^ln11-ooo]. There is no
word or content for the photocopier: only paper and image. The photocopier's
"job", if you will, is to lift a picture from one page and to impress it into
another. It does so by temporarily imaging text (as picture) onto a
photo-sensitive drum. Ink powder sticks to the electrically charged surfaces of
the drum in correspondence to the shapes on the page. The shapes are then
rolled onto a new page, re-inscribing the image into the new medium. The text
is never immaterial. But for a moment it finds shape as an invisible electric
charge. The transformation should not be reduced to some sort of mystical,
metaphysical moment. On the contrary, in instrumental terms we observe the
relatively mundane process of media independence.

Let's linger on that moment of remediation. The process of textual
transcription by hand involves a similar transformation. When a scribe copies a
page from the bible, for example, he also "lifts" content from paper.  Not
unlike a photocopier, the human stores text in the electro-chemical pathways of
the brain, before reproducing it once again into another medium. And like a
photocopier, the human can perform the copy function mechanically, without
comprehension and on a purely formal, visual level. In fact, the historical
record is full of errors that suggest that pre-modern scribes wrote at widely
varying levels of literacy [@goudsmit_illiterate_1974,
@bucking_training_2007].[^ln11-literacy] In the Muslim tradition, the prophet
Muhammad himself is sometimes called "the unlettered prophet," to emphasize
fidelity and lack of mediation in the transcription of the message
[@calder_ummi_1990, @gunther_muhammad_2002, 1-26]. In other words, the Qur'an
claim to authenticity relies on the prophet's ability to copy the message
"verbatim." On the conservative Muslim view, anything but a faithful
transcription of the original text amounts to an interpretation, not
self-identical to the letter of the text (a translation, for example)
[@tibawi_is_1962, @fatani_translation_2005, @wilson_first_2009].[^ln11-quran]

Where the photocopier placed a printing press into every office, the printer
placed one on every desk. Falling cost of print.

Finally, the text exists on the screen and magnetic media only, where the cost
of reproduction approaches zero.

### 5.2 Copy Text (textual criticism)

The division of text into form and content makes a difference in more
utilitarian ways as well. For example, imagine the challenge of compiling all
known commentaries on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, by hand or programmatically. The
problem of what edition to use as the "base" for such a project presents itself
immediately. In the words of Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine, the editors of
*Folger Digital Texts*, "readers assume that there is a single text for the
plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare's plays were not published the
way modern novels or plays are today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions,
represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by
his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example,
three very different versions of *Hamlet*, two of *King Lear*, *Henry V*,
*Romeo and Juliet*, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their
base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from
the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text" [@mowat_textual_2012]. In other words, where the readers expect to
encounter *Hamlet* as a single, unified idea, they instead encounter a
multiplicity of slightly diverging textual "witnesses." Errors in transcription
and editorial interventions accumulate. The proliferation of unlicensed copies,
translations, and imitations further adds to the complexity of the problem.

Editors of classical literature will often solve the problem of diverging
copies by designating one version as canonical, preserving the formal
characteristics of the given version down to individual line breaks, as is
often done with Platonic dialogs. It then becomes possible to collate
commentaries, connecting each to individual words and passages at their
canonical location. The problem remains in the abstract: which version to count
as canonical? The act of deciding on what constitutes an authoritative edition
can quickly become a contentious issue, particularly when the text in question
carries religious or political significance.

A whole field of textual criticism exists in the service of negotiating
"critical" editions which in some way preserve the struggle to reconstruct a
measure of authority. But what should count for being authoritative? A number
of logical possibilities find as many ardent adherents. For some, the act of
deriving the authoritative text lies in reconstructing authorial intent, using
the author's notes, for example, or from first-hand witness testimony. Others
place a premium on reconstructing and analyzing the writing process itself, in
what has been dubbed as "genetic criticism" [@deppman_genetic_2004, 1-36]. Yet
another approach will compare multiple editions of the same text to derive a
possible meta-text, preserving all extant variations. Yet others will simply
rely on their judgment to produce what they believe is a "true" text based on a
number of personal and eclectic considerations [@bowers_rationale_1950,
@bowers_shakespeares_1954, @mcgann_radiant_2004]. Such approaches to textual
criticism have at least this one thing in common: behind the fuzzy profusion of
textual material they perceive the outlines of a single, unified work. As G.
Thomas Tanselle (a prominent textual scholar) puts it, "one must be able to
distinguish the work itself from attempts to reproduce it."[^ln11-tanselle] For
a textual critic of his kind, all real-word variants and reproductions are
suspect because possibly corrupt in some way. Despite its careful attention to
the materiality of the text as artifact, textual criticism in this vein remains
a classically idealistic pursuit. The work exists as an ideal form in the realm
of the ideal.

[ln11-tanselle]:  "Whatever concept of authorship one subscribes to, the act of
reading or listening to receive a message from the past entails the effort to
discover, through the text (or texts) one is presented with, the work that lies
behind" [@tanselle_rationale_2010, 13-18.].

Ruskin lamp of memory.

"It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that
has every been great or beautiful in architecture [...] That spirit which is
given only by the hand and eye of the workman, never can be recalled. Another
spirit may be given by another time, an it is then a new building; but the
spirit of the dead workman cannot be summoned up, and commanded to direct other
hands, and other thoughts. And as for direct and simple copying, it is palpably
impossible. What copying can there be of surfaces that have been worn half an
inch down [@staniforth_historical_2013, 2]?"

"But it is said there may come a necessity for restoration! Granted. Look the
necessity full in the face and understand it on its own terms. It is a
necessity for destruction. Accept it as such, pull the building down, throw its
stones into neglected corners, make ballast of them, or mortar, if you will'
but do it honestly, and do not set up a Lie in its
place"[@staniforth_historical_2013, 3].

the Infant, having been injured by damp, was restored by Sodoma and made much
less beautiful than before. And, in truth, it would be sometimes better to
leave works half spoilt, when they have been made by men of excellence, rather
than to have them retouched by inferior masters." 1550 Tim's Vermeer.

Colliveau set about [restoring]this picture with uncommon solenity, because it was his
own. He began with the most delicate pumice stone, and very soon got into the
walls of th building, but was astonished to find the apearance of bricks and
mortar still, although not guite soneat; he soon cleared away the wall on
discovering a room beyond, and pictures, furniture, &c. most beautiful.
Gracious powers! how was he agitated; forgetting totally the mischief he was
commiting, his elbow went like a fiddler's; every thing vanished.---However,
finding a bed, the curtains of which (a dark green) were drawn close, he went
to work upon it ver tenderly; presently a pot de chambre came  in sight!---His
whole souldwas absorbed; his face all one ghastly grin; his legs (like German
flutes) tottered under him. Not that great philosopher Guffin Ragba, was more
agitated while cutting the leather from off his bellow, to disover how wind was

he found a lady asleep, very beautiful, because very fat, and a Dutch woman.
Now this part I did not see, and I believe but very few besides himself; but
alas! hew was soon to be at the end of his discoveries. Having got a glimpse of
some gilding, he redoubled his efforts, when he found it was an inscription; it
was in Dutch, and nearly thus, as translated by Mr. Peter La Cave:---"Now
caitiff, meditate on th havoc though hast made throughout thy lie, and go thang
thyself. In this picture, wretch! though have destroyed, what to the end of the

hides, as he rogresses all the preliminary layers upon which the etxternal
colours depend for durability and lustre. And hence, not on the meaning and
spririt of the work must be understood; the restorer must also be familiar with

We have now traveled from the pixel down to magnetic storage media and back
from the storage media to the screen. The passage opens up space between
visible content, media, and the imposed forms that govern any and all higher
notions of literary activity "floating" above this nominally "digital" layer.
Technology does not determine the literary space: it has only the potential to
hide implicit mechanisms of machine control, or, to offer possibilities for
transformation not otherwise available to other forms of textuality. Loosely
coupled to its material contexts, text can continue its relentless drive from
matter to idea and into other matters as long as its passage is not hampered by
regimes that prohibit further sharing, remixing, and transmediation. I say nothing
yet of the potential necessity of such regulation. Under certain conditions, in
the name of privacy, security, or property rights, it may become necessary to
flatten out and to treat text as more of an analog, media-bound modality of
communication, limited in its ability to move across minds and cultures. But,
it is also in our broadly human, civic interest to keep such mechanisms of
constraint visible to view, under continual scrutiny of critical, close, and
closest possible reading.

### 5.3 Authenticity (problem of copies)

It is quite odd, if you think about it, to believe that objects somehow retain
an aura or a trace of their history: "a handkerchief used by Princess Diana,"
or "the cigar box owned by President Kennedy." In some real sense, the
historical patina covering these objects is only imagined. President Kennedy's
fingerprints and the tears of Princess Diana have long disappeared from their
physical medium. Their trace cannot be reduced to "mere" physical
characteristics: that is, to actual scratches, stains, or molecules,
recoverable from the object. Rather, the object had to "be there" in some way,
acquiring a patina of authenticity. "Having been there" is what gives the
object value, sentimental or otherwise, in a condition that refuses formal
reduction to a set of merely material properties. The high price contemporary
society places on authentic artifacts is therefore a type of magical thinking.
Walter Benjamin's famous essay on the work of art in the age of mechanical
reproduction appears to both celebrate and lament the demise of such magic.
"The technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain
of tradition," wrote Benjamin. "By making many reproductions it substitutes a
plurality of copies for a unique existence. And in permitting the reproduction
to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it
reactivates the object reproduced. These two processes lead to a tremendous
shattering of tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and
renewal of mankind" [@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. And yet, for Benjamin, the
easy reproducibility of modern art forms like film and photography also
"emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual"
[@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. One could read Benjamin's famous essay as a
piece of technological nostalgia, or as an expose on the magic and superstition
latent in modernist art. Crisis or emancipation? Benjamin feels both, and in
doing so he captures the metaphysical anxiety of the modern age. We desire for
our Vermeers to stay special but also for a Vermeer to hang in every home,
peering back at us from a multitude of anonymous reproductions.

The modern world faces the challenge of authenticity, which we have only began
to assimilate: politically, economically, and philosophically. The ubiquitous
holographic certificate of authenticity on a luxury handbag or on a "Digital
Versatile Disk" (how antiquated the DVD sounds already!) is a cheap band-aid
hiding the immaterial nature of these artifacts. Fashion and software companies
are reluctant to talk publicly about piracy,[^ln11-counter] because the so
called "knock-offs" are essentially exact duplicates, often "leaked" from the
very same factories producing the original.

Note that it makes no sense to talk about "what was meant" by the designer of
the handbag, the way textual critic may talk about authorial intention. Nor
would it make sense to "correct" some perceived flaw in the painting by
Vermeer. The practice parallel to "textual criticism" in visual arts is
restoration. Although similar to textual criticism in its aims to recover some
notion of the original, crucially, the practice of art restoration takes place
without reproduction. Unlike a critical volume, which essentially reprints the
work in its reconstructed entirety, restoration happens at the site. All
"unauthorized" copies constitute a forgery that competes for attention with the
original. One could say that for painting and handbags "matter is synonymous
with meaning," but the sentiment strains at the limits of critical vocabulary
in the tradition that gives us only the binaries of form and content.

The context-dependence of an artifact is not even medium-specific, as
Goodman would suggest. Texts are more allographic than handbags and paintings,
but Vermeers and Louis Vuitton purses are also in some sense perfectly
reproducible, like texts. They are texts, and I do not mean it in some
post-structuralist notion of "everything is a text."[^ln11-derrida]

Technologies like 3D scanning and printing increasingly reduce physical objects
to their textual representation, as is the case with the stereo lithographic
document (STL) format that describes objects for 3D printing.  Here, for
example, I reproduce code that describes "a surface" of a functional gun (the
code made available online by *Defense Distributed*, a self-described civic
liberty activist group):

```
22=(
BOUNDED_SURFACE()
B_SPLINE_SURFACE(1,2,((#34104,#34105,#34106),(#34107,#34108,#34109)),
 .UNSPECIFIED.,.F.,.F.,.F.)
B_SPLINE_SURFACE_WITH_KNOTS((2,2),(3,3),(15.1641909236141,15.3257778193699),
(2.99329024107099,3.14159265358979),.UNSPECIFIED.)
GEOMETRIC_REPRESENTATION_ITEM()
RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_SURFACE(((1.,0.997252058758362,1.),(1.,0.997252058758362,
1.)))
REPRESENTATION_ITEM('')
SURFACE()
);
```

This piece of code exists in its Platonic ideal *before* the physical artifact.
As costs of reproduction approach zero, so does the line between an object and
its description. Imagine a world where to think "gun" is also to seamlessly
bring one into existence. The erosion of boundaries between object and idea has
a pronounced effect on the governance of goods, felt precisely at the
distinction between the autographic and the allographic. Governments currently
regulate the manufacture and the distribution of guns as artifacts, but how
does one regulate guns as texts and ideas? Any such effort amounts to
censorship. What was first regulated under the regime of property law, now
increasingly falls under the regimes of intellectual property and rights to
speech. Where does that leave the practice of textual criticism? In such a
world there can be no distinction between works and texts. Unlike millions of
reproduced Vermeers (which no doubt occupy this world in the form of postcards,
posters, and photographs), text is text. It lies before us in glorious
flatness, as thick as a sheet of paper.

Text as I have already began to define it Chapter One, is a digital mode of
representation, defined, at least in part, by a relative lack of "stickiness"
to its physical medium. Textual artifacts therefore exhibit the dualism between
text and work to a much greater extent than other forms of art and
communication. A Vermeer is always a work. Not so with *Hamlet*. "Hamlet" may
indicate a category of relate, or, an individual instance of a given work.
Philosophers Nelson Goodman and Catherine Elgin explain this peculiarity by
making the distinction between "works of art whose identity depends on their
history of production" and works whose identity does not. The former they call
"autographic" and the latter "allographic" [@goodman_reconceptions_1988, 65].
These terms will be useful for us throughout the book. Architecture and
painting, in this view, are strongly autographic disciplines. An exact copy of
a Vermeer or of a building by Frank Lloyd Wright could never rise to the status
of the original. The originals have what Walter Benjamin called an "aura or
authenticity." No amount of precision, down to the molecular level, could
substitute for the historical patina of the original artifact.

Text as vector. Barthes: text as "an organism which grows by vital
expansion"[@barthes_work_1978, 161].  "The metaphor of the Text is that of the

Internet is not rhyzomatic. Mediation is at stake. " But the bottom line is
that dumb-pipe email is unmediated, and therefore it's a business that Google
wants to get out of as soon as it can."

" It's also why I believe Google will kill Gmail as soon as it comes up with a
mediated alternative everyone loves. Of course, Google may offer an antiquated
"Gmail view" as a semi-obscure alternative to the default "Inbox"-like mediated
experience."

Science lecture vs. humanities. Stuff that is known. Stuff that is not known

What does it really mean to "know" something? Or to have "read" a book? I have
had the following conversation countless times. Someone asks, "Have you read
Nabokov's *Pale Fire*," and I respond, "Yes I have." But there is a world of a
difference between reading it yesterday, last week, or ten years ago. The book
as an interface leaves an organic trace in the human mind---an imprint that
begins to fade as soon as it is created.

How much knowledge is there in the world? According to a recent paper published
in Science, 295 exabytes (or billion gigabytes).[@hilbert_info_2012;]

Whatever consciousness is, it is propelled forward on a thin edge of material
substratum. Reality exists only in the now, where the past is a memory and the
future only a possibility. Imagine whispering something to a friend. It does
not have to be very complicated, something like "I love you" or "I miss you."
The whisper dissipates as soon it is uttered. The percussion of the speaker's
breath creates temporary order: giving shape and pushing air molecules into
waves of pattern and form. That order begins dissipating as soon as it is
created. Within milliseconds, molecules return to their natural state of chaos.

To steel ourselves against entropy, we change the substratum from air to stone.
It's molecules are more stable. Etched in stone will be the same message. It
will last longer now. But it will also take longer to create. You will have to
carry around your tablet and chisel. The message etched in stone will outlive
the whisper and indeed will

with self.
