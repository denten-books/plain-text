# Chapter 4: Literature Down to a Pixel

Screens have one major peculiarity: they refresh themselves multiple times per
second. Even those shapes that appear to stand still on them continuously move
at a speed beyond the threshold of human perception. We are vaguely aware of
this movement: it is commonly visible when a screen appears on another screen,
as it does in documentary films that show someone typing at a computer
terminal or watching television. The difference in flicker rates between the
projector showing the image and the projector "in the frame" is what produces
the characteristic horizontal interference pattern. Such glitches give us a
glimpse into the nature of simulation.

The sign is no longer immutable, as if etched in stone. Rather, we observe it
in motion. The "illusion" of digital textuality is a consequence of the
dynamic property of projection. To place texts on a screen is to bring them
closer to the moving image. What does it mean to perceive seemingly static
words through a fundamentally dynamic medium? What happens to literature that
takes place on cinema screens?

In previous chapters, we have encountered the shape of the conduit: keyboards,
screens, storage. In this chapter, a short meditation on the digital
commonplaces in popular culture precedes two case studies, one from the
material history of telegraphy and the other from the history of modern
display technology. Archival material---patents, blueprints, phenomenological
accounts from the early history of word processing---will be brought to bear
on a debate concerning the nature of digital representation and perception in
the philosophy of aesthetics.

I will question the term "digital," a descriptor everywhere now used yet so
poorly felt and understood. One intuits that it has something to do with
numbers or fingers, but something more is always at stake in its distinction
from analog. That something---a remainder, a trace---will be my focus here.
Through a series of case studies that test our theoretical intuitions against
the material realities of digital representation, I will advance, as always, a
materialist, computational poetics, which foregrounds a thick description of
the device. The chapter will engage with the elemental particulates of two
primal media conduits: electric ether and liquid crystal, the media behind the
telegraph and the liquid crystal display (LCD).

I am also concerned with a phenomenological description of human perception.
My goal is to disturb the comfort and congruity between organ and device. The
two mold and reshape each other. This dialectic must be disturbed for
understanding to take place. The nature of "digital" experience might appear
to be an intrinsic property of the medium. But, under closer examination, as I
argue, it reveals itself as a political construct that lays claims on the
body, structuring the physical affordances of communication. The change of the
*medium* from paper to pixel entails a series of corresponding changes in the
*mode* of perception. The projection "attunes" the viewer to the message. By
attunement I mean something analogous to what Marcel Mauss calls the
"techniques of the body" [@mauss_techniques_2006, 78], the way in which we sit
for example: the position of the hands, the head, or the movement of the eyes.
Attunement structures apprehension. It answers the "how" of perception.

It would be wrong to conflate the medium with the message in this context. At
stake in the digital--analog divide is rather the reader's ability to do
something with the text. Throughout this chapter I will use the word "medium"
to narrowly identify the physical conduits of representation.[^ln3-oed] Thus
the medium of painting is paint and canvas; the medium of books is paper and
ink. The gained precision in terms will help later, when I consider more
complicated and interested edge cases.

A change in medium often implies a corresponding change in the *mode* of
perception. At some level of music production, for example, classical music
may involve a family of brass woodwind instruments, shaped to move and vibrate
air. Brass, wood, wind, and air are all reasonable *media* through which sound
and vibration can travel to a listener's ear. The *mode* of music appreciation
is listening, which involves a set of conventional cultural techniques: the
buying tickets, the fact that that there are tickets, dress code and proper
comportment at a concert. A person from the deaf community may use other modes
of listening, like leaning against sound amplifying speakers or touching the
woodwind.

Yet at another stage of music production, classical music involves notation. A
whole system of distribution is built around the printing and circulation of
sheet music. The modality of reading sheet music, as opposed to listening,
requires a completely different grammar of body postures. It engages different
practices and different cultural and financial institutions.

We confuse the conversation when we conflate the modality of information
(music, image, text) with the physical channel of its transmission (air,
liquid crystal, paper). Modality determines the message to a much greater
extent than the medium. In fact, in most communication systems the medium
serves as a relatively neutral conduit. One can use a violin to transmit a
concerto, or a secret message. The medium remains the same, whereas the mode
of apprehension changes. To decode a secret message played by a violin, the
listeners might have to attune themselves to a different pitch. The modality
in short shapes the act of listening, where air, wood, and strings remain
agnostic to the information being transmitted.

Initially, we must know how to perceive using the right senses: when to look,
smell, or listen. The modality further contains the message's "register,"
which shows us how to identify its signifying elements. In refined arts it
goes further to govern bodily technique: one must neither speak nor cough
during a classical recital, for example. One can look at but not touch artwork
in a museum. The modality of communication ultimately demands corporal
compliance; it is a claim on the body. Therein lies the starkest difference
between analog and digital media. The shift from one to the other affects not
the message but the mode of perception. It is as if someone has asked you to
read a book or to watch a film in a stranger's armchair. It feels "off" in a
way that is difficult to explain.

The mode of digital perception similarly contorts the body into new and
unfamiliar shapes, which often give discomfort. Something happens when digital
media subsume their analog counterparts. But what is it?

## Digital Wake (My Two Terminators)

What does the digital look like? It looks blue for one---not just any kind of
blue, but a particularly cool shade of pure blue, which passes from dark to
white, to translucent with starburst-like overtones. An online image search
for the word "digital" produces many sharp, sterile visuals of that kind.
Abstract geometric patterns predominate in the first dozen or so search
results: often forming curved, three-dimensional tunnels or lines that
resemble circuit boards. There are things too of course, cheap and expensive
consumer things like scanners, memory cards, circuit boards, and backup
drives, but most of all there are cameras---digital cameras, which stand in
stark contrast to "traditional film photography." Few marketplace objects
exhibit such a strong sense of the opposition between the digital and the
analog as a consumer camera.

These search pages also contain the outdated clichés of yesterday's digital
detritus: digital clocks, purple lightning bolts, and the abstract chrome
landscapes made widely available by graphic editing software in the 1990s.
There are numbers. The preferred arrangement is in a torrential grid---the
matrix---descending in the background, behind a generic humanoid form, also
translucent. Or better yet: alphanumeric characters comprising a globe or a
face. Ones and zeros are best arranged as an unending string, which runs at a
slight angle on the Z-axis and beyond the frame, foregrounding whatever object
that is meant to take on the digital as a property: the digital wake.

When we constrict the image-search to the twenty-first century, we see these
cool-blue images give way to a more varied palette: bright prime greens,
yellows, and reds in retro-geometric pixelated shapes. Pixels take the place of
numbers here---not the small, invisible pixels of contemporary computer
screens, but the large and boxy pixels that by their pronounced boxiness flaunt
their digital being. These images allude to a time when pixels really did stand
out as individual units, when technology was not refined enough to produce the
illusion of visual continuity. This faux lo-fi aesthetic likely appeals to the
romantic nostalgia many feel for the early days of computing, and yet it also
asserts its independence from that history. No longer shall the digital serve
to emulate reality, nor be judged merely by its degree of lifelike
verisimilitude. The blocky world of Markus Persson's *Minecraft* (2011) stands
in antithesis to the magical realism of Cyan's *Myst* (1993), the best-selling
graphic-adventure PC game of the twentieth century. Where the critics lauded the latter for its moody and
atmospheric photo-realistic environments, the former embraces the playful,
8-bit, low-fidelity aesthetic of gaming consoles from the 1980s. The
pseudo-pixelated world of Minecraft encourages its inhabitants to experiment
with deconstruction, producing cuboid landscapes that foreground discontinuity
of form and surface.

Digital iconography works in another direction too, by approaching and
challenging the perceived continuity of the analog world. Liquid-metal
*Photoshop* font effects are thus supplanted by hyperrealistic renderings of
fire, smoke, and water: fluid elements that are difficult to render digitally,
especially in movement. Digital alchemy approaches the boundaries of
technological possibility, but absent the constraints of realism it pushes
past reality, past nature, and past mere fidelity to the natural world. A
real-world explosion caught on film looks cheap in comparison to its cinematic
"special-effects" simulacrum. A blazing corporate logo rendered digitally
would lose much of its appeal were it produced by literally lighting a
logograph on fire. The burning digital logograph does not just say "We are
hot!" or "We are on fire!" (that would be too naive)---it says that our fire
is better than fire, more vivid and more lifelike. The digital fire is the
ideal, Platonic image of fire: an image that all fires should emulate.

I am evoking these commonplaces to get at the conflicting popular intuitions
about "the digital" as something at once discrete, angular, and therefore
reductive and deterministic, but also shiny, smooth, perfect, and liquid in
the way that drowns out or transcends everything susceptible to time,
everything that has a distinct shape and anatomy. Consider the transition
between between *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2*. In the former, the "bad"
robot that sets out to destroy humanity is cast as an animatronic mechanism.
In the latter, it is an amorphous puddle of mercury that makes the original
mechanical Arnold seem like a friend and savior [@cameron_terminator_2001;
@cameron_terminator_2003]. The first terminates with shotguns and tire irons;
the second morphs into human shapes and pours itself inside, threatening life
from within.

Like the terminators of yesteryear, digital sprites and bogeymen have lost
their hold over popular imagination. Digital photography, digital clocks, and
digital humanities already ring archaic in their futuristic ambition, going
the way of e- or i- anything: the way of retro-suffixes like -bot, -mat, -lux,
and -tron. The digital dissolves into the everyday as all clocks, all books,
all texts, in short, all human activity passes through some form of "digital
being." My aim here and throughout has been to understand what is meant by its
evocation: to "come to terms," to make visible, to disturb it, to denature,
and to make it strange again.

"Digital media," "digital humanities," "the digital divide:" they share a
word, but "digital" suggests entirely differing qualities depending on the
context. In some cases, digitality stands in opposition to a notion of
naturally "analog" human experience. Thus, digital media reduce "fuzzy" and
indeterminate human experience to something binary, discrete, and
deterministic. In his influential monograph *The Cultural Logic of
Computation*, for example, David Golumbia insists that "languages are not
codes." Human language practice for him therefore should not be reduced to a
"single correct interpretation" or "at the absolute limit, a determinate
number of discrete interpretations" [@golumbia_cultural_2009, 19]. "To submit
a phenomenon to computation," Golumbia writes, "is to striate otherwise-smooth
details, analog details" [@golumbia_cultural_2009, 11]. Following Deleuze, he
conceives of "striated space" in opposition to spaces "smooth" and "analog"
like brains, society, politics, language, and baseball
[@golumbia_cultural_2009, 22, 130-5]. For Golumbia, striated and digital
phenomena fall under suspicion because "our society is already oriented
towards binarisms, hierarchy, and instrumental rationality"
[@golumbia_cultural_2009, 222].

In his essay against digital humanities, Stephen Marche worries about the
digitization of human experience for the opposite reason. Smoothness, in his
view, is a property of the machine. "Meaning is mushy," he writes:

> Meaning falls apart. Meaning is often ugly, stewed out of weakness and
> failure. It is as human as the body, full of crevices and prey to diseases.
> It requires courage and a certain comfort with impurity to live with.
> Retreat from the smoothness of technology is not an available option, even
> if it were desirable. The disbanding of the papers has already occurred, a
> splendid fluttering of the world's texts to the winds. We will have to
> gather them all together somehow. But the possibility of a complete,
> instantly accessible, professionally verified and explicated, free global
> library is more than just a dream. Through the perfection of our smooth
> machines, we will soon be able to read anything, anywhere, at any time.
>
>Insight remains handmade [@marche_literature_2012].

In this vision, digital artifacts now fall under suspicion for smoothing out
difference and thereby for betraying some essential, wonderfully messy
property of being human.

Stanley Fish, another prominent critic of the digital humanities, writes in a
similar vein. The traditional humanities for Fish exist within the "linear,
temporal medium in the context of which knowledge is discrete, partial and
situated---knowledge at this time and this place experienced by this limited
being." By contrast, the digital humanities imagine a "steady yet dynamic
state where there is movement and change, but no center, no beginning and end,
just all middle." The digital vision is meant to deliver us from linearity and
from time itself [@fish_digital_2012]. Indeed, Fish argues, the digital fails
because it does not offer *enough* of a difference:

> Delivered from linearity, from time-bound, sharply delineated meanings, from
> mortality, from death, everyone, no longer a one, will revel in and
> participate in the universal dance, a "mystical dance" of "mazes intricate,
> / Eccentric, intervolved, yet regular / Then most when most irregular they
> seem, / And in their motions harmony divine / So smooths her charming tones,
> that God's own ear / Listens delighted. (John Milton, "Paradise Lost," V,
> 620, 622-627) [@fish_digital_2012]

Whether too discrete or too continuous, critics agree on the danger of
digitization. Digital being follows determinism and mechanization as the
opponent to humanism. Whether it is Plato discussing the role of writing in
*Phaedrus*, or Fish discussing the development of digital humanities through
Milton, critics worry that successive modes of representation fail to weave
the human experience into the fabric of new media. New media thus always
retreats from some previously constructed category of the human, with one
audience applauding the liberatory, post-human potential of the motion and the
other lamenting its potential for destruction and demise. A vision of humanity
is always at stake, with all its spiritual and political consequences.

Because apprehension is grounded in the physical capabilities of human
perception, new media affect the very notion of what it means to be human. I
am interested first and foremost in the challenge digital media pose to
humanity as a determined, a priori category.[^ln5-apriori] The repeated
contradiction in debates around digital media exposes a historically
contingent anxiety. Both orthodoxies of humanism and the futuristic ambition
of post-humanism are therefore displaced onto the same digital--analog
continuum. The material conditions of media production do not, however, allow
for social constructivism unmoored from the senses. The development of
telegraphs and televisions depended on the limits of human perception.
Likewise, the illusion of continuity disappears when a projection flickers
much slower than 60 frames per second. We are left then somewhere between
social constructivism and technological determinism. A historical account of
digital media must therefore acknowledge both the contingent and the essential
characteristics of perception.[^ln3-cont]

In what follows I offer two case studies that challenge commonly expressed
intuitions about digital media. They reveal that ostensible "properties" of
media are in fact claims on the mode of perception.

[^ln5-apriori]: An a priori given because one must be human first to critically
examine the concept.

## Spiritual Telegraph

The contemporary attempt to "fix" human experience on the spectrum between
discrete and continuous representation echoes a similar conversation that
occurred at the turn of the previous century. The parallels suggest that our
present belief in the essentialism of corporeal technique---writing by hand,
for example---in fact constitutes an arbitrary idea of the human.

Consider the spiritual conversations surrounding telegraphy. At the time
before the standardization of the telegraph alphabets, multiple ways of
translating language into electrical signal competed for their share of the
rapidly growing telecommunications market. Soon, a well-publicised feud
emerged between proponents of direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC)
based systems. A few technical details are necessary to understand how an
argument about engineering designs gained a metaphysical significance.

Telegraph systems based on direct current design converted electrical current
flow into dashes, and the absence of current into dots.[^ln3-ndc] Systems based
on alternating current designs converted Morse code (and other encoding
systems) into pulses of alternating positive and negative current, where
positive current could stand for "dashes" and negative for "dots." Direct
current designs preferred the use of the "saw tooth" or "square" periodic
waveforms to represent binary states. The signal was either "on" or "off" with
nothing in between. By contrast, literature on alternating current designs
often argued for the use of the more round, sinusoidal signal, which covered
a more "organic" range of amplitudes. The sinusoidal wave could be modulated
into a multitude of states [@crehore_practical_1900; @hausmann_telegraph_1915,
374]. Instead of being just "on" or "off" it offered measurable points of
current intensity along the curve of the sine wave. Consequently, alternating
current designs tended towards the transmission of continuous quantities like
images and cursive handwriting. The sinusoidal curve itself resembled natural,
organic shapes, like handwriting. The alternating current suggested a visual
analogy between the thing being transmitted (picture or text) and electric
signal.

The Pollak-Virag telegraph that Bernhard Siegert mentions briefly in his
seminal essay on German media theory was one such device.[^ln3-virag] The
original Pollak-Virag machine patented in 1900 sent regular Morse encoding by
means of alternating current of two different polarities and two different
strengths, for a total of four types of signals.[^ln3-siegert] Other than the
irregular signal shape and the use of alternating current, the Pollak-Virag
encoding differed little from single-Morse systems. By 1901, however, the
authors were issued an American patent for the "Writing Telegraph," which built
on their previous design in an interesting way.  Rather than using a wave in
four steps, the authors proposed an "automatic transmitter [...] capable of
sending current impulses over the line which correspond to the direction and
the size of a single letter element" [@pollak_writing-telegraph_1901, 3]. In
other words, they wanted to bend the sinusoidal wave to correspond roughly to
the shape of the letter. In this way, the letter "s," to pick an easy example,
could be transmitted by the means of an s-shaped wave.

![Record obtained at the receiving station, illustration from "Means for
Rapidly Transmitting Telegrams," 1900
[@pollak_means_1900].](images/virag-wave.png)

![Writing Telegraph, 1901 [@pollak_writing-telegraph_1901].](images/virag.png)

The Pollak-Virag design thus aimed to constitute an electrical alphabet
analogous to cursive writing: "to trace in a substantially continuous unbroken
outline the written letters composing the matter transmitted"
[@pollak_writing-telegraph_1901, 1]. To achieve this, the engineers broke
cursive script down into distinct vertical and horizontal elements. The
Pollak-Virag encoding thus represented a continuous quality---cursive
script---through discrete atomic elements, as punches that moved the writing
stylus in cardinal directions---up, down, left, or right. It was not a purely
analog device. The analogy was rather achieved through a process of discrete
analytic atomization of script on ticker tape and its subsequent reconstitution
into a continuous shape. The cardinal directions comprise an intermediate,
discrete description of smooth handwriting curves. Pollak and Virag believed
that their sine wave telegraph had the distinct advantage of transmitting
messages "recorded in ordinary written or script characters." In the language
of the patent, other forms of "facsimile" telegraph transmitted merely the
"conventional form" of the letter, and not the letter itself, whereas the
Pollak-Virag system was "non-autographic" [@pollak_writing-telegraph_1901, 1].
The autographic telegraph preserved the particularity of the human hand. It
purported to transmit the peculiarity of an individual's signature. It was the
"humane" telegraph in the sense that it preserved a human trace.

The metaphysics accompanying telegraph communication at the time were in fact
often concerned with human erasure. Notions of material discreteness and
continuity represented not mere physical attributes of encoding or electricity
but higher-order cultural and even ethical categories. Beneath the technical
conversations about the advantages of discrete or continuous electrical signal
lay a philosophic concern with the fundamental makeup of the universe itself.

Henri Bergson, for example, wrote about the "real whole of the universe,"
which constituted an "indivisible continuity" [@bergson_creative_1944, 36].
Science, technology, and other "artificial systems" in his thought imposed
discrete "partial views" on the whole.[^ln3-bergsonism] These partial views
resembled the operation of the cinematograph, he wrote, which divides
continuous motion into distinct frames. By running the frames through the
projecting apparatus, the telegraph reconstituted "the individuality of each
particular movement." "Such is the contrivance of the cinematograph," Bergson
wrote, "[a]nd such is also that of our knowledge."[@bergson_creative_1944,
332] In this way, the intellect continually separated the undifferentiated
reality into discrete states of time and space [@bergson_creative_1944,
167-182; @russell_philosophy_1914, 4]. But these states were virtually, not
actually, discrete. The evolution of life proceeded, according to Bergson,
"rather like a shell" which "bursts into fragments," which are themselves
again shells [@bergson_creative_1944, 109]. The new differentiated unit, a
part of the indivisible universe, contained the kernel of the whole. It did
not split from but subsume the totality.

In Bergson's view of the universe, the brain and the central nervous system
act as a "central telephonic exchange," which communicates between the
extrinsic continuous world and the intrinsic "memory-shot[s]" of our
perception [@bergson_matter_1912, 19, 280]. The mind receives "images" of the
world that it compares with existing "stored" images to produce a new
composite image that is once again stored into memory. Bergson thus denied the
"flashlight" model of perception. The mind, according to him, does not shine a
light to bring attention to this or that hidden feature of the world:

> Metaphor for metaphor, we would rather compare the elementary work of
> attention to that of the telegraph clerk who, on receipt of an important
> dispatch, sends it back again, word for word, in order to check its accuracy
> [@bergson_matter_1912, 123].

The object in the world is thus neither an independent thing nor purely a
product of the mind. By this "telegraphic" model of perception, Bergson avoids
both fully relativistic and fully essentialist accounts of knowledge making.

To agree with Bergson is to imagine the mind as a cinematographic "framing"
device and accept that the world is a priori continuous in nature. In a
damning evaluation of Bergson's philosophy, Bertrand Russel noted that such
assumptions were merely poetic images, not subject to verification
[@russell_philosophy_1914, 24]. They hold the truth of poetry, as Russel
wrote, not truth of physics or philosophy. To this day, it is difficult to
find scientific consensus on such topics as the "digital make up of the
physical world" or on the continuity of conciousness. There was certainly no
consensus on the matter in Bergson's time. Even the nature of telegraphy was
disputed at the time. There were telegraphs that used discrete digital signals
and those that used more analog, continuous ones.

Consider the following passages from the Swedenborg-inspired *Spiritual
Telegraph* in 1854, in which an anonymous author expounds a theological media
theory that hinges on what he or she assumes to be the ultimately discrete
nature of the universe.[^ln3-swedenborg] Anonymous writes:

> Whenever two persons are brought into sympathetic relations, either by
> corporeal contact or through those refined media which pervade the Universe
> and serve as the airy vehicles of thought, they mutually feel the presence
> of each other [@brittan_spiritual_1854, 169].

In this relationship "the mind which is gifted with the greater degree of
activity and power" at once attains a hierarchical relation to the lesser
intellect, becoming "the proximate cause and fountain of inspiration to the
other" [@brittan_spiritual_1854, 169]. God naturally occupies the highest
point of such a pyramid:

> from sources superior to ourselves, the very elements of life and thought
> flow into us, and every living thing, according to its nature and discrete
> degree, derives a kind of inspiration from that which is above
> [@brittan_spiritual_1854, 169].

The discrete degree must be preserved, in other words, because without it the
hierarchy would lose meaning. Thus, to facilitate the "transmission of
impressions," "the recipient" of the vital flow "must be willing to receive
instruction, and assume the passive or negative relation of a learner." Without
discreteness and without hierarchy he will resist "the infusion of foreign
impressions and Divine ideas" [@brittan_spiritual_1854, 169].

In this essentially telegraphic model of the universe, to deny the step-wise
hierarchy of "refined media" is to close oneself off to the "transmission of
impressions," in a communication act---consisting of a "contact" and the
exchange of signifying "thought vehicles"---between "source superior" and the
"receiver of instructions," who are placed in a binary and opposing relation
--"negative" but without "resistance"---to the idea of the divine.

Unlike Golumbia and Fish, telegraph spiritualists associated determinism with
continuity not discreteness. Witness one George Henry Dole writing in his
*Philosophy of Creation*, in 1906:

> Scientists have prosecuted research on the plane of *continuous degrees of
> the ultimates*, and they have thereby failed to penetrate to *interior
> things of discrete degree* [emphasis mine]. Consequently they derive life as
> not from the Lord, but from nature, of which they have no other idea than
> that it is something mechanical [@dole_philosophy_1906, 236-7].

Telegraph spiritualists shunned continuity because it mixed sacred and
profane. They believed that a truly Christian order would remain digital in
essence. To claim otherwise would be to propagate the Gnostic heresy
[@edwards_neglected_1990; @shaked_dualism_2005, 52-71].

Where Bergson believed the telegraph to translate continuous "analog"
experience into discrete "digital" snapshots, the Swedenborgian mystic saw it
as a model of communication that maintained fidelity to the hidden order of
a well-differentiated and discrete universe. Their intuitions were completely
opposed. When arguing against sine-wave telegraphy in 1905, Donald Murray,
whose alphabet would become the basis for modern character encodings like ASCII
and UTF-8, displayed a similar bias against analog quantities, which, for him,
could encode complex human activity like writing or dance. "About ten years ago
there was a brisk discussion in some of the electrical journals in regard to
the advantages of the simple harmonic curve or sine wave for the transmission
of power by by the alternating current," he wrote.

> [I]f Smith wants to make Jones spin round like a dancing dervish, the best way

Murray, contrary to Bergson, assumed that human experience was discrete by
nature. For him, the regular and continuous sine wave fell under metaphysical
suspicion, just as the discrete nature of computation would fall under
suspicion for contemporary critics like Golumbia and Fish. Human experience,
in Murray's view, is analogous to the saw-tooth wave: fragmentary,
non-periodic, and irregular. The sine wave, by contrast, had the "exotic"
characteristics of being cyclical, repetitive, and continuous. The shape of
the square wave more closely resembled Murray's own normative vision of human
culture.[^ln3-dervish] But how or why would any piece of technology confirm to
some "natural" state of human affairs?

The appeal to normative discourse in this context belies a kind of a
technological essentialism, reductive of both technology and human nature.
Neither can be definitively reduced to universal notions of "discrete" or
"continuous." Under close examination, human perception and cognition involves
a complex synthesis of analog and digital processes.  Telegraphs and computers
too function in the digital mode at some layers of the system, and at others
in the analog. The very distinction between digital and analog, as we will
continue to question it in this chapter, comes under increasing doubt.

It is tempting to think of the telegraph as a digital [*sic*] apparatus,
created to convert analog [*sic*] input into electric signal.[^ln3-tele] The
innards of the Pollak-Virag telegraph for example reveal complex dynamics that
involve long chains of trans-coding and trans-mediation, that oscillate
between discrete and continuous qualities: in order to be transmitted, the
signal must travel through biological "wetware," ink and paper, the mechanical
action of cogs and wheels, and finally, through copper wire by means of an
electric signal. In the process, language, already a discrete and portable
representation of thought, undergoes a number of further material-phase
transformations. In the writing telegraph, this involves what I have been
calling, borrowing from the language of concrete poetry, inter- or
trans-mediation: from notebook to paper tape to the movement of an
electromagnetic vibrator to the recording mirror galvanometer into the copper
wire to the receiving vibrator and into the machinations of the printing
apparatus that once again produces ink and alphabet.[^ln5-intermedia] This
entire system further participates in the complexities of the human
neurological apparatus, involving haptic, visual, and cognitive feedback.
Neither wholly digital nor analog, the signal undergoes multiple encoding
changes in transmission.

[^ln5-intermedia]: On intermedia in concrete poetry see @wendt_sound_1985;
@higgins_intermedia_2001.

I would like to pause for moment to define my terms. By "encoding," I mean a
"controlled system of representation." Representation in its unrestrained form
(as in "pictorial representation") differs from "encoding" in the size of its
vocabulary. Painting and other forms of uninhibited representational
conventions offer limitless expressive possibilities. The "language" of
painting is infinite. Encoding, by contrast, reduces the universe of
expressive possibilities to a limited number of salient "codes," like the
alphabet. These codes have a formal grammar and rules of composition.
Although the expressive potential of written language is limitless, in some
combinatorial sense of the word, language and other codes can "break," that
is, be reduced to nonsense, in a way that painting strictly cannot.

It becomes clear from the description of early telegraph encoding systems that
transcoding and transmediation are related. On the one hand, all changes
between encoding systems necessitate phase transition. Telegraph signals
change as they move from paper to wire. Transmediation, on the other hand, may
or may not involve a change in encoding formats. Morse code remains the same
whether played on a violin or transmitted via telegraph. The encoding changes
however, when human speech is transferred into Morse code. In reading and
playing music, a musician furthermore transforms musical notation---a
controlled, paper-bound vocabulary---into sound waves, unlimited in their
expressive potential.

Blueprints for the writing telegraph reveal a device that mixes discrete and
continuous modes of representation, through multiple acts of transcoding and
transmediation. Digitality, in that sense, is besides the point. The telegraph
is a device that pushes language, normally bound to air (as speech) and paper
(as a writing system), through water and metal. Even today, deep beneath the
sea surface, telecommunication lines ferry messages from continent to
continent.[^ln5-underwater] At each end of the telegraph cable is a
transmediation device that enable media transference: the message has to be
extracted in some sense from the language of copper cables into the language
of fiberoptics, into the language of solid state storage, and so on to the
entorhinal grid. I use the word "media" here in the bluntest way possible: as
"material basis" or "substratum" for some observed, higher-order
phenomenon---in our case, communication).

## Soap Opera Effect

Consider another case study. Modern televisions began shipping with a feature
called "Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation" (MCFI) in 2010. It caused some
viewers to report what was dubbed the "soap opera effect." Everything looks
cheap to a viewer experiencing the soap opera effect. Even the familiar,
critically acclaimed blockbuster featuring top acting talent and expensive
camera work looks unnatural, as if produced on home video. I am quite
susceptible to this phenomenon myself. Under the MCFI effect, a shot's
dynamics look somehow fabricated. The actors, even in films that I have known
and love, appear to be faking it. Their acting seems forced and "over the
top." I notice their makeup and their props. It is like watching bad silent
cinema.

MCFI was developed to correct motion blur that occurs on flat-panel liquid
crystal displays (LCDs). LCDs work by passing light through a liquid crystal
medium, sandwiched between two polarized light filters and positioned at 90
degrees to each other. As light enters through one side, it twists following
the slightly curved molecular structure of the crystal, allowing the beam to
rotate and pass through both filters. The structure unwinds when it receives
an electrical current, which effectively blocks light from passing through the
medium. The gates close, so to speak, as the second filter prevents light from
exiting. By this refractive structure, a series of small, pinhole-like pixels
can be turned on and off to create shapes, letters, and images on the
screen.[^ln3-mishima]

In addition to filtering light, modern displays also flicker at a precisely
calibrated rate. What we observe as a static image on screen, is in reality a
highly dynamic projection. Traditional film projectors advance through 24
frames every second. The film camera's shutter similarly moves up and down 24
times per second, capturing a static snapshot at each turn. The projector and
the camera are thus in sync.

Furthermore, a projector's light flickers two to three times per frame, giving
it a "refresh rate" of 48–72 cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz), which produces
the effect of continuous motion. Without this strobe effect, under continuous
light, the succession of frames would appear a blurry streak of
undifferentiated images.

An image persists in the human visual field for about 16 milliseconds after
the stimulus passes, giving humans the temporal resolution of around 60 images
per second. Consequently, an average person reaches the state of "critical
flicker fusion"---in which the strobe light becomes unnoticeable---at refresh
rates equal or higher than 60Hz. At the limits of flicker fusion, the image
begins to persist through the gaps between frames, creating the appearance of
continuous motion [@efron_conservation_1973; @coltheart_iconic_1980;
@brannan_applications_1992]. Below the threshold of flicker fusion the viewer
would will notice the strobe effect, which hinders viewing.

LCDs mimic the action of an analog projector by refreshing the screen at
intervals between 60 and 120Hz. This happens even when the image is wholly
static, like the page of an electronic book.

Humans, to complicate matters, are more sensitive to rapid motion at the
periphery of vision, in a mechanism likely evolved to detect predatory attack
[@burr_temporal_1981; @didyk_perceptually-motivated_2010]. As humans move
closer to their screens---when sitting in front of a computer monitor, for
example---more of the image enters their field of peripheral vision, making
them more sensitive to screen flicker. When sitting close to a screen, flicker
can become more noticeable because more of the moving image enters the
sensitive area of peripheral vision adept at perceiving rapid movement.

Furthermore, being closer to a screen increases the angular velocity of any
depicted moving object. When viewed from afar, the movement of several inches
on screen corresponds to a change in a sight angle, and likely a few
millimeters of iris movement. When viewed up close, the same several inches on
screen correspond to a much larger angle, forcing the iris to move further
laterally.

The human visual system is particularly adapt at tracking smooth, horizontal
movement, cognitively anticipating the perceived trajectory of a laterally
moving object, while stabilizing the retinal image and keeping it at the
center of the fovea in what is called "smooth pursuit" lateral eye movement
[@rottach_comparison_1996; @purves_types_2001;
@didyk_perceptually-motivated_2010]. To put it simply, we are good at tracking
things that move horizontally, like an antelope running across the plains.
Even though our brain cannot capture such movement smoothly, it fills such
gaps to create the illusion of smooth movement sideways. This makes us good at
anticipating the trajectory of laterally moving objects, another likely
adaptation that favors self-defense and hunting. But beyond some threshold,
and particularly when things move rapidly up and down, the motion begins to
appear jerky. Think of tracking a fly, for example, which appears to skip from
one place to another as our visual system struggles to process its complex
trajectories and threshold-crossing speeds.

The "sample and hold" nature of LCDs frustrates the cognitive assumption of
smooth movement. The brain assumes that moving objects move smoothly. But on
screen, the object's anticipated location does not always correspond to its
actual trajectory, since the motion of a represented object-image in the frame
does not follow the anticipated physics of a similarly sized real-world
object. Trajectories of moving objects on screen are subject to the vagrancies
of video editing and recording. Because of the flicker, the movement is
actually jerky; it is missing frames. The moving object appears at discrete
stationary locations punctuated by gaps in on-screen movement. This mismatch
between what is expected and what is perceived appears to the eye as blur.
Shapes become fuzzy in motion under certain unfavorable viewing conditions
[@klompenhouwer_motion_2004; @har-noy_lcd_2008]. To complicate matters
further, the on-off phase transitions of the liquid crystal medium are not
instantaneous. The individual pixel "fades" instead of vanishing at once,
leaving a physical (and not merely a perceptual) trail of not-quite
transitioned pixels in the wake of object movement [@kurita_moving_2001;
@pan_lcd_2005]. Digital television runs into the analog limitations of the
liquid crystal medium.

To put all of these factors together: we observe film shot at 24 frames per
second on LCD screens that redraw the screen at 60-120 times per second. The
disparity between the low sampling rate of traditional film and high sampling
rate of modern monitors confounds human perception, which evolved to process
motion in a particular way. The liquid crystal is also not a perfectly digital
medium. It exhibits analog trailing effects. To make matters worse we
increasingly watch television on small hand-held devices, close to our field
of vision. The combination of these factors made early LCD displays unsuitable
for home entertainment.

To compensate for motion blur, LCD manufacturers introduced a technology
called Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation (MCFI), by which the television
itself inserts artificially computed frames in between the original stock
footage. The algorithm averages the moving object between two frames, creates
an approximation of its position, and injects the computed frame into the
action. The extra frames should, in theory, make the motion appear more
natural, filling in the missing gaps that confuse the brain. Unfortunately for
the viewer, the effectively higher sample rates carry a major unintended side
effect. Most viewers associate sampling rates of 40Hz and above with daytime
soap operas, which were, for a time, shot on lower quality (but more modern)
video equipment as opposed to expensive legacy film equipment used by the
big-budget film industry.

Film is expensive because film cameras work by fixing the image onto the
medium through a photochemical process. Like traditional film photography, raw
footage must be developed and processed properly before it can be used for
editing, playback, and distribution. Video and more modern, digital recorders,
by contrast, transform light into fluctuations of the magnetic field, storing
the results on magnetic tape or solid state "floating gate" storage. The
transducer (tape head) reads and writes directly from and to tape, making
magnetic storage significantly more compact and less expensive than film, as
it does not require chemical processing for playback
[@edgerton_columbia_2009].

Crucially for our story, video recorders operate at 60 frames per second, a
recording resolution that together with the distinctive video color profile
and audio aberration signatures give rise to what viewers perceive as that
"cheap video" "soap opera" look. By inserting extra frames into the moving
image, modern televisions in effect alter the apparently expensive, slow
format to match its faster, cheaper video equivalent. The net improvement in
sampling degrades the perceived quality of the original. The motion may be
smoother, but it begins to looks unnatural, in that it subtly differs from the
acculturated practice. It gives the eye too much detail. Minutiae of costume
and makeup become much more readily apparent, breaking the spell of acting and
dissolving the fourth wall.[^ln3-wall]

[^ln3-wall]: It would be interesting to try to create the reverse effect by
reducing the fidelity of a "cheap" soap opera video feed to the more
"expensive" look of film shot at 24 frames per second.

The soap opera effect undercuts some of our most ingrained intuitions about
the analog--digital divide.

First, it challenges the easy equivalence between "digital" and "discrete"
properties of the medium so often found in critical literature. According to
accepted intuitions, film (the more discrete format of representation) more
closely approaches the analog (continuous) nature of observed phenomenon,
despite being the more fragmentary medium. Under closer examination, however,
it reveals itself to be more digital than digital video, particularly if we
take "digital" to mean "discrete" and "differentiated." The incongruity
between detailed material contexts of perception and theoretical speculation
points to a confusion in the common terms. Since screens play a key part in
the reception of all "digital" media, film and text, we must carefully peel
apart the layers of the visible image to reveal the mechanics of projection.

Second, it seems that the material properties involved in our understanding of
"digital" and "analog" formats are also implicated in higher-level functions
of aesthetic judgment. Perception of quality in a given recorded performance
drifts with the vagrancies of encoding. "Good acting" inexplicably falls apart
with the introduction of extra frames. This should worry the critic unfamiliar
with artifacts of digital conversion. Even an introductory examination of the
soap opera effect, reveals sensory glitches and distortions which affect the
coupling between organ and device. In fact, the illusion of cinematic motion
itself takes advantage of the idiosyncratic particularities of human vision,
which is limited by image persistence and evolved to perceive smooth lateral
motion. A more perfected visual apparatus would perceive flicker at much
higher rates and have no persistence visual trail artifacts.

Finally, where the literature often places "artificial" digital discreteness
in opposition to "natural" analog continuity, a thick description of our
perceptual apparatus reveals a complex patchwork of fragmentary cognitive
mechanisms, already digital and discrete in their operation.

At some level of analysis, gaps in the encoding format relate to gaps in human
visual processing. Neither can be said to represent reality with perfect
fidelity. Instead, brains and cameras stitch landscapes together from unevenly
sampled visual topographies, achieving a measure of arbitrary synchronicity
between human and machine.

Critical literature often conflates the discrete nature of digital
representation with human debasement, following the logic by which the
perceived material impoverishment in one sphere leads to the implied spiritual
impoverishment in the other. The sentiment is everywhere in the popular press,
having deep intellectual roots in the history of thinking about technology.
Philosophers of technology from Heidegger to Kittler advance a powerful
"hermeneutics of suspicion" towards mechanization, digitization, and the
subsequent computability of human experience. To take that tradition seriously
is to direct hermeneutic suspicion to aspects of digital being that have
meaningful socio-political consequences. If, as the case of motion blur
suggests, human experience is already and always "born digital," that is,
discrete and differentiated throughout, we must find ways of advancing
critique along theoretical distinctions that better capture the instrumental
reality of media practice. Nostalgia for "analog" oneness and continuity
should itself fall under the critical gaze, examined alongside media marketing
slogans advertising gapless playback and lossless file formats. To long for
the analog is to long for the experience of oneness, which was never there in
the first place.

Indeed, it appears that the whole matter of digital representation rests on
arbitrary and contingent assumptions. If language and literature are already
digital and discrete systems of representation, why should it bother us when
it is otherwise digitized or transcoded into other controlled vocabularies?
The Latin letter already comprises an atomic and indivisible unit. When it is
further broken down into pixels, the smallest indivisible units on screen, it
undergoes little change in its ontological categories. Just as one learns to
translate an alphabet's arbitrary shape into distinct sounds, one can learn to
translate arbitrary digits into letters and back into sounds and thoughts.
The language of machines, in this sense, is merely another language. Which is
not to say that all aspects of the computed sign are completely independent of
sensory constraint. Humans cannot perceive the ultraviolet spectrum, for
example. Nor would it be practical to create books so heavy as to prevent
readers from turning the pages. Sensory constraints do determine the shape of
the message to some reasonable extent. The medium is "tuned" to average human
capabilities.[^ln4-opera]

[^ln4-opera]: Yet other techniques of apprehension are socially constructed.
Thus although all opera is in the human-audible frequency range, acculturation
to opera listening helps greatly in its enjoyment. Some aspects of opera
appreciation are learned (like knowing the plot) where others are determined
(like the ability to hear sounds).

## We Have Always Been Digital

My case studies of the Pollak-Virag telegraph and the liquid crystal display
reveal our frequent misunderstanding of the term "digital."  What does it
mean, for example, to "digitize" film, if is already a digital medium?  What
properties are being brought forth through digitization, if the digital cannot
simply be equated with discreteness? Aesthetic theorists and analytic
philosophers have long debated the nature of digital representation. A summary
of their conversation lays bare the term's latent complexities.

The difference between discrete and continuous quantities defines the
conversation about digital media.[^ln3-maley] For example, in a popular book
about what a "well-informed person should know about computers," Brian
Kernighan describes "analog" as conveying "the idea of values that change
smoothly as something else changes" [@kernighan_d_2011, 21]. Much of the
world is analog, Kernighan explains. A water tap, a pen, or a car steering
wheel are all examples of analog interfaces. For example, when riding a
bicycle, turning the handlebars one way results in a corresponding motion of
the machine. This motion is smooth. Compare that with the action of a light
switch. A properly functioning light switch takes on two discrete states only:
on or off. A range of pressure applied to the switch does not correspond to
any mechanical action of the lever. But once a certain threshold is reached,
the switch "flips" to change states. "Digital systems," as Kernighan writes,
"deal with discrete values" [@kernighan_d_2011, 22]. The switch contains a
limited number of state possibilities, where the bicycle handlebars could be
rotated in an infinite number of minutely differing gradations.

Nelson Goodman was one of the first philosophers to examine digital
representation in the context of aesthetic theory. In the late 1960s, drawing
on technical intuitions about devices like pressure gauges and computers he
proposed to call those notational systems "analog" that are "dense" and
"undifferentiated in the extreme." By contrast, he called digital systems
those that are "discontinuous" and "differentiated throughout"
[@goodman_languages_1968, 159-164]. By this definition, written language and
music notation are digital systems par excellence, having the property of
reducing the undifferentiated, analog input (human thought) into discrete
semantic units (text or musical notation).[^ln3-goodman] Following Goodman's
logic one can reasonably maintain that the art of painting, unlike music or
language, cannot be reduced to the production of discrete semantic units, and
would be more of an analog system under the proposed definitions.

In this light, the language of pointillist painting, which breaks shapes down into
their modular atomic components, transforms an analog art form into into a
digital one. Similarly, in the cuboid world of *Minecraft* the player
interacts with blocks: the smallest differentiated units that constitute all
other more complex things in the game. The world of *Minecraft* is sparse and
therefore digital. By contrast, the world of the hyper-realistic *Myst*
depicts the painting-like, semantically irregular reality that cannot be
broken down into neat components. *Myst*, a digital game, depicts a dense,
undifferentiated, and analog world.

But Goodman's definitions strain under closer examination. Plainly, *Myst* is
also a digital game. All digital images (and worlds) follow the logic of
cubism to its deconstructive conclusion in that they atomize analog quantities
into discrete and differentiated points of light. The world of *Myst* like the
world of *Minecraft* is made of pixels. At some deeper level of analysis, both
worlds are sparse and differentiated throughout. Could we not say the same
thing about all rule based analog games, like chess? On the level of syntax,
Chess is also a sparse game, discrete and differentiated throughout like its
computer counterparts. One plays on top of a grid with pieces that move
according to rigidly proscribed rules and along binary color distinctions. At
another scale of analysis however, chess is an analog game. The wood grain of
the chess board is part of a dense, undifferentiated world. At a deeper level
still, at the atomic scale of observation, the chess board again begins to
appear sparse, discontinuous, and differentiated throughout. We are left
without the critical means to tell wood-and-(faux)ivory chess pieces apart
from block-and-pixel pieces of *Minecraft*.

The quality of being digital depends on our perspective. Density and
sparseness changes with the viewer's ability to *perceive* differentiation.
Ultimately, these qualities belong not to the object of representation---chess
or computer game---but to the viewer. In the 1980s, philosophers engaging with
Goodman's earlier work, began to move away from discussing digital
representation in terms of media properties and towards a more process-based,
viewer-depended understanding of the terms.

For example, an interesting corollary to the continuous property of analog
systems is our inability to duplicate their states exactly. I can approximate
the pressure someone else puts on their bicycle handlebars with some arbitrary
measure of precision that never reaches perfect reproducibility. This means
also that while more digital art forms like literature are, in some sense,
perfectly reproducible, analog forms, like painting, are not. Following similar
reasoning, the American philosopher John Haugeland proposed to consider the
quality of being reproducible as essential to our understanding of digital
representation. Reproducibility, for Haugeland, involved "flawless copying
[...] and preservation" [@haugeland_analog_1981, 213]. To the definition of
Goodman's digital systems, he therefore added the notion of "feasible
procedures" that can lead to "positive" and "reliable" processes for reading and
writing digital tokens [@haugeland_analog_1981, 214].

Let us consider Haugeland's propositions in relation to some of our previous
case studies. The movements of the chess game are indeed perfectly
reproducible. In fact several conventions exist to ensure the perfect
preservation and the reproducibility of chess games. These include the
"descriptive" and the "standard algebraic" chess notations. By contrast,
individual chess sets are not perfectly reproducible. Each is a somewhat
unique version of the same "regulation" ideal. Importantly, sometimes drastic
differences in the shape of the figures and the materials used to make chess
sets are not meaningful in the context of the game. They may be meaningful to
those collectors, who prize certain chess sets for their craftsmanship. But
"craftsmanship" is not in itself a signifying property of chess. It is only
meaningful in the "game" of collecting.

By contrast, no amount of copying can reproduce an original Rembrandt. Every
aspect of the painting is meaningful, including those not visible to the naked
eye: like the traces of other paintings or sketches hidden under the surface
representation. This would hold true even if an invented technique could make
a perfect, molecule-by-molecule, reproduction of Rembrandt paintings. The
rules of fine art collection demand an original work of art that preserves the
provenance of the artifact, including incidental bumps, scratches, and patina
accrued through history. Such marks carry no meaning "by the rules" of
painting, but they do carry meaning "by the rules" of collecting.  By
Haugeland's definitions painting is an analog genre. But if one were to
disregard the rules of collecting, if one simply enjoyed looking at beautiful
pictures, they would be justified in treating painting as a perfectly
reproducible art form. Painting would, in essence, become digital for them.
Similarly, our ability to reproduce Rembrandt makes his paintings more
digital, which is strange because this changes nothing about the object. Its
ontological status shifts with the viewer's technological capabilities.

With regard to discreteness, moving images lie somewhere between the extremes
of competitive chess and fine art. In the case of the soap opera effect, we
may think of analog film as a series of still shots. For some purposes, these
still shots are reproducible in mass quantities, although not perfectly.
Multiple copies of each film reel are routinely distributed to multiple
cinemas. Each is "authentic" in the sense that is is sanctioned by the movie
studio. Yet, from another perspective, each frame is also an irreproducible
work of art, which like painting can accrue the patina of time, and in some
context attain value based on such unique properties as belonging to this or
that prominent film director. If we consider celluloid-based film
cinematography in terms of "irreproducible series of paintings," we can also
consider magnetic storage-based videography in terms of "perfectly copyable
magnetic facsimiles." It becomes possible then to value magnetic tapes on par
with paintings or film stills. Magnetic tapes can become, in a sense, unique
works of art. But such thought experiments are rendered void because humans
cannot observe magnetic traces directly. Whatever sense of valuable
degradation or patina particular to magnetic storage media is lost on the
average human collector. Once again, we see that qualities like
"reproducibility" and "patina" depend on the capabilities of the observer and
not on any intrinsic property of the medium.

In 2008, the philosopher Matthew Katz proposed two further important
theoretical qualifications to the digital-analog debate. First, he
distinguished between "format" and "medium" in digital representation.
Second, he proposed that the digital-analog distinction often depends the
observer. To illustrate these two amendments, Katz imagined a measuring system
that involves a supply of marbles in a large beaker. We can thereby agree to
use a "handful" as an approximate unit of measurement with that system. Thus
one can observe a situation in which the beaker contains "three handfuls of
marbles." Katz's system is analog, even though marbles themselves are a
perfectly discrete medium, because it establishes no precise convention to
reproduce handfuls. The marble-beaker system violates Haugeland's requirement
for "positive and reliable" standards of reproducibility. My two handfuls
might be different from yours due to the difference in the size or our hands.
Where the medium (marbles) is discrete the format (handfuls) is analog.

The mechanism of measuring is depended on the measurer. It is analog because
we cannot accurately perceive approximate quantities. Were humans able to
magically discern the exact number of water molecules in a beaker, previously
analog systems (like unmarked beakers) would in effect become digital.
Similarly, were humans endowed with hands of a definite size and volume,
"handfuls" would be counted as discrete and therefore digital quantities.
From similar thought experiments, Katz concludes that the physical,
perceptual, and cognitive capabilities of the "user" (reader, audience,
perceiver) affect the ontological status of the system, a handful of marbles
or a work of art [@katz_analog_2008].

Katz's seemingly minor amendments to Haugeland have several radical practical
consequences on our discussion. The physics of the medium, he reveals, are
significant only in so far as they are tied to our ability to impose order in
formatting. Whether the beaker is full of marbles or water is irrelevant.
What is crucial is our ability to format the medium into exactly reproducible
chunks. We are can do that with marbles by counting, but cannot with water.
Undifferentiated matter like cake is only analog until someone cuts it into
pieces. And the technique of cutting is important. The ontological status of
cake changes depending on the agent doing the cutting. For someone armed with
a laser cutter and a microscope the cake is, on a spectrum, a near perfect
digital medium. It is analog for those cake cutters who approximate their
slices.

Our confusion about the dual status of *Myst* therefore resolves when we
introduce the distinction between medium and format. *Myst* is digital *for
those who can access the game's code*. This binary layer is not normally
accessible at the site of the projection. The player does not operate at the
site of the archive, where the bits that produce surface images actually
reside. The player therefore perceives the computed scenery as analog
representation. The property of being digital thus indicates the *systematic
ability to impose structure*. *Myst* is digital for a programmer and analog
for the player. The quality of the digital separates those that create
differentiation from those who holistically apprehend the differentiated
structure---those to whom structure is an absolute given.

Further, note that from an instrumental point of view, to make something
digital, in Katz's final formulation, implies the separation of structure from
the medium. The painting remains analog as long as it remains irreproducible.
It becomes digital when the viewer is able to impose structure, by which the
visual form is "lifted" from the medium of canvas. We could also say that to
digitize means to enable "flawless copying and preservation" through "positive
and reliable means." When taken outside of their philosophical context, such
actions acquire an immediate practical implication, say to a librarian. The
mechanisms of "flawless copying and preservation" are social, technological,
and institutional mechanisms. They vary by cultural and political contexts.

Human language can be thought of as a digital artifact then, as long as it is
free and participates in the unhindered trans-mediation of thought---from mind
states to voice, from voice to paper, and from paper to other mind states.
Without such chains of transmission there can be no culture, in the sense that
culture constitutes a shared intellectual achievement. Any sense of
collectivity relies on each participant's ability to effect change in the
material contexts of representation. I participate in the collective as long
as I am free to separate thought from its natural medium ---my brain: to speak
out loud, to write thoughts down on paper, and to pass notes to others. When
we insist on preserving some notion of holistic analog unity, we ultimately
risk total censorship. At the extreme of a purely analog representation lie
mental images that cannot be separated from their medium and therefore cannot
be transmitted. Media independence transcends the intellectual confines of an
individual. Without digital, in this new sense, portability, all
representation---art and knowledge---attaches itself irrecoverably to
untranslatable and irreproducible conditions of its material production.

These are the beginnings of an argument against analog modes of being. Truly
digital text can be copied and placed into other hands and minds, feasibly and
reliably. The possibility of enacting such procedures is what ultimately gives
representation its digital form. Our senses limit our ability to format: to
impose structure onto media. We cannot, for example, communicate in the
infrared spectrum, without proper instrumentation. In general, our ability to
format media, to make it digital, is limited from without, by political means.
A document classified by a government, for example, loses some of the
necessary preconditions for being digital. One is literally not allowed to
copy it. It has to remain embedded within this particular piece of paper on
this particular desk. Technologies like "digital rights management" (DRM),
which limit a reader's ability to copy books similarly transform digital
content into its media-dependent, irreproducible, and ultimately analog forms.
Paradoxically, a paper-and-ink book that places no restrictions on copying and
transmediation provides for a more digital format than its electronic book
analogs, particularly when such electronic books restrict the reader's ability
to copy and transmediate. Another way to put it would be to say that on
"protected" devices like proprietary e-book readers the content is digital for
some users and analog for those without permissions to copy, share, and
transform.

The word, already a discrete quantity, comes into digital being as form when
coupled loosely to its material contexts. Ontologically, text is by nature a
digital format: first because it represents discrete units of information
about the world, and second, because it allows for some measure of "flawless
copying and preservation." Copying and preservation constitute the logic
compelling the historical advancement of writing. But, note that "flawless
copying and preservation" are in themselves contingent (not fully determined)
properties of writing. For example, imagine a world in which ideas forever
"adhere" to their brain-bound media.[^ln3-brain] Imagine also a society that
positively prohibits the transmediation of thought, on paper or between brain
cells. Envision extreme forms of thought control that restrict fundamental
basics of speech and literacy, prohibiting the manufacture of pens, paper,
computers, photocopiers, voice recorders, and word processors.  Such
prohibitions would amount to total censorship. A radically analog society
would also be wholly mute.

Understanding digitality as an kind of order, a format that arranges matter in
certain ways tied to particular affordances of specific devices, recasts the
history of computing into something other than simple "mathesis," the idea
that computation reduces the world into more discrete, and therefore
computable, elements. That notion would be true if the computer was simply a
glorified calculator. But computers are more than that. In practice, they
reveal themselves to be self-amending machines for universal transmediation
---machines that, depending on the user's acuity and dispensation to access
deep structure, separate readers into those for whom texts and images exist as
fixed analog given and those for whom they exist in a fluid form. Computation
implies the ability to impose structure onto the world: a liberty to exchange
one symbolic order for another among signs, people, and machines.

## The Medium Is Not the Message

In examining the material conditions of digital representation we find
format---a quality distinct from both medium and content---emerging as a
political construct that governs the physical affordances of communication.
Where we started with vague intuitions about the essence of digital
representation, we end on firmer ground, at which formatting identifies the
ability to impose structure onto the medium. Formatting, long under-theorized,
matters because it frames the medium as well as the affordances of
apprehension. How the cake is cut also determines how we eat. To format text
without margins, for example, is also to deny marginalia. And to format text
in a way that prevents further remediation is to deny the formation of shared
culture.

Critics like Fish and Golumbia are rightfully suspicious of unexamined claims
about digitization. But they are suspicious for the wrong reasons.
Digitization threatens humanity only in so far that it lays claim on the
recipient of the message. It can facilitates understanding by shaping
undifferentiated blocks of text into paragraphs, by giving space to
annotation. But formatting can also hinder apprehension. It can structure
attention in ways that discourages or outright prevents critical thought.

In his influential essay on the political quality of technological artifacts,
Langdon Winner famously argued that in modern times "people are often willing
to make drastic changes in the way they live to accord with technological
innovation" where they would, at the same time, "resist similar kinds of
changes justified on political grounds" [@winner_artifacts_1980, 135]. The
insight is yet to filter into the life of literature. Readers, writers, and
critics who would be pained to support legislation in favor of literary
censorship and surveillance effectively promote such systems in daily use. The
mismatch between political belief in practice comes from the lack of critical
engagement with technology, which as Winner writes, requires "both the study
of specific technical systems and their history as well as a thorough grasp of
the concepts and controversies of political theory" [@winner_artifacts_1980,
135]. Winner elucidates this dynamic through the case study of Robert Moses
and his twentieth century highway building projects in New York city. Moses
built low overpasses with an eye towards discouraging bus travel, which
reflected his social and racial biases. These in effect carried the force of
legislation, Moses argued, denying people of color and the poor access to
public spaces [@winner_artifacts_1980].

Similarly, in our case, claims on a reader's attention can happen through
legislation, by social convention, or through specific material affordances,
like the inability to take notes or to share books among family and friends.
Such technological constraints disproportionately affect those most reliant on
informal knowledge networks, which exist outside of economies of wealth and
prestige. Digitizing the public archive without a thorough understanding of
the platforms and technologies involved, risks committing the public to an
empty and impoverished vision of social knowledge production. Technologies
that hinder "feasible procedures" for reliable "copying and preservation"
create textual artifacts less digital than paper books. They push us towards
privatized knowledge economies. To "read" becomes to "purchase temporary
reading rights"; note-taking becomes susceptible to exploitation, censorship,
and surveillance.

Consider the seemingly innocuous decision to distribute scientific literature
formatted in the ubiquitous Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf). Adobe, the
American company responsible for introducing the file format into circulation,
describes it as "allow[ing] the faithful, high-quality reproduction of printed
matter in electronic form" [@shore_acrobat_1995, 379]. Text, when transmitted
without formatting specifications, loses its shape to some extent. Think about
writing an email for example. What appears to you as lines of a certain width,
may appear to the recipient in a completely different form. You may have
written your email on a large stationary monitor, for example, where your
recipient reads on a small, portable device. Because the formatting is not
fixed, the email program is able to reflow the lines appropriately. You have
in essence delegated the responsibility for formatting the text to the
reader's device. Readers are then free to apprehend it in a manner most
convenient for them: tailored to their specific needs, attention spans, and
body types. The downside of having this freedom is that the sender cannot
assure excellence in formatting. The reader's software may render the text
poorly or make it outright unreadable.

The PDF solves this problem by guaranteeing its recipient receive the message
exactly as written, without delegating the responsibility of rendering it to
the reader. In essence, the format mimics the constraints of the printed page,
which similarly preserves the shape of the message during transmission. When
writing a letter by hand, you know that your recipient will see what you see,
in the same shape and form. But to achieve the effect, the portable document
format must also limit the viewing possibilities of the document. Thus if the
sender fixes the width of the page to the standard legal letter size, the
reader would be pained to read such a document on a smaller, portable device.
The PDF converts an essentially textual, that is digital format into a visual
one. Strictly speaking, PDF documents do not contain text, in a way that an
email does. Rather, they contain text like a photograph of a printed page
does, as an image. Such constraint is useful for business communication, when
writing contracts for example. The party responsible for drafting the contract
wants to know that it would signed without alteration.

Yet for other purposes, such fixity of formatting is detrimental to
communication.  Where reading paper contracts sent through the mail is free,
the reading of PDF documents requires specialized software, which may cost
money. PDF further hinders the copying and the preservation of text---the
formal prerequisites for digital media. The simple act of taking notes becomes
a paid feature of the Adobe Acrobat software. What was gained in a minor (for
scholarly communication) convenience of formatting is lost in a major
concession to the privatization of public knowledge. We have in effect
instituted a document format that is less flexible than paper. Because
"copying and preservation" are key values for university libraries, the loss
of unimpeded "copying and preservation" should outweigh any gains in purely
ornamental stability of document format. This does not mean that we should not
use Adobe Acrobat files, only that we must, in all cases, be intellectually
invested in the compromises involved.

Technology does not determine literature: it has only the potential to
hide implicit mechanisms of machine control, or, to offer possibilities for
transformation into other forms of textuality. Loosely coupled to its material
contexts, text can continue its relentless drive from matter to idea and into
other matters as long as its passage is not hampered by regimes that prohibit
further sharing, remixing, and transmediation. I say nothing yet of the
potential necessity of such regulation. Under certain conditions, in the name
of privacy, security, or property rights, it may become necessary to flatten
out and to treat text as more of an analog, media-bound modality of
communication, limited in its ability to move across minds and cultures. But,
it is also in our broadly human, civic interest to keep such mechanisms of
constraint visible to view, under continual scrutiny of critical, close, and
closest possible reading.

[^ln3-ndc]: Also known as the "single current" or "single Morse" system. @welk_neutral_2000

[^ln3-current]: ITA-2 could also be adopted to work with "double current"
devices, in which case 0 would represent "negative current" and 1 "positive
current" [@itu_telegraph_1932, 36].

[^ln3-kittler]: This along with the ominous "laying of cables" that concludes
Friedrich Kittler's *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter*.

[^ln3-tele]: See for example @angell_pro_2009, 233:  "The telegraph is a
digital device, sending only high and low pulses through the wire;"
@jepsen_my_2001, 195: "The telegraph was a digital device that used dots and
dashes in a manner similar to the ones and zeroes of digital logic;"
@comer_internet_2006, 32: "The telegraph is a digital device because instead of
sending a continuous signal that is an exact analog of the input, the telegraph
clicks to send the individual characters."

[^ln3-cont]: Gregory Hickok, a prominent UC Irvine cognitive scientist wrote:
"The brain samples the world in rhythmic pulses, perhaps even discrete time
chunks, much like the individual frames of a movie. From the brain's
perspective, experience is not continuous but quantized [...] This is not to
say that the brain dances to its own beat, dragging perception along for the
ride. In fact, it seems to work the other way around: Rhythms in the
environment, such as those in music or speech, can draw neural oscillations
into their tempo, effectively synchronizing the brain's rhythms with those of
the world around us" [@hickok_its_2015].

[^ln3-brain]: At the physical level, the process of textual remediation begins
at the brain, as when thoughts are initially transcribed onto paper.

[^ln3-art]: "Replaceable" and "reproducible" as in the sense that an art
gallery perseveres through the continual loss and rearrangement of its
constituent art works.

[^ln3-maley]: See for example @maley_analog_2011: "the received view is that
analog representations vary smoothly, while digital representations vary in
stepwise manner. In other words, 'digital' is synonymous with 'discrete,' while
'analog' is synonymous with 'continuous'" [@maley_analog_2011, 117]. See also
@kittler_there_1995, "Confronted as they are with a continuous environment of
weather, waves, and wars, digital computers can cope with this real
number-avalanche only by adding element to element."

[^ln3-goodman]: Goodman differentiates between "syntactic" and "semantic"
density. Some notational systems like writing and the decimal system are,
according to Goodman, "syntactically differentiated but semantically dense"
[@goodman_languages_1968, 161]. The key distinction for him seems to be
a "limit on the length of message," by which I think he means something related
to infinite divisibility [@goodman_languages_1968, 164]. The decimal system as
a whole can continue to approach a quantity indefinitely, reaching an arbitrary
point of precision. The computer limits decimal precision to some arbitrary
"depth" of approximation, making it semantically discrete. I find this part of
the argument unconvincing.

[^ln3-oed]: The Oxford English suggests as one of the usages "Any physical
material (as tape, disk, paper, etc.) used for recording or reproducing data,
images, or sound" [@oed_medium_2001].

[^ln3-siegert]: Siegert takes the Virag as an "apocryphal" emblem of a
"systemic...logic" in the "dominant cultural technique," representative of the
"order of digital signals" [@siegert_cacography_2011, 41]. Although not
concerned with the history or philosophy of digital media explicitly, Siegert
suggests that the writing telegraph symbolizes the cleansing of "the noise of
all graphic form." His theory of cultural techniques instead creates "an
awareness for the plenitude of a world of as yet undistinguished things, that,
as an inexhaustible reservoir of possibilities, remain the basic point of
reference for every type of culture" [@siegert_cacography_2011, 32, 35].

[^ln3-virag]: The Pollak-Virag device also proposed an "electromagnetic
vibrator" coupled to a recording "mirror-galvanometer." The authors further
specify for "the vibrator of the receiving instrument [to] vibrat[e] in harmony
with these impulses, vibrating in one direction or the other, according to
their sign and to an extent depending upon their intensity" [@pollak_means_1900].

[^ln3-dervish]: One could make more of the Dervish being used here as a
negative example, in an instance of colonial gaze. But Murray himself was an
empire outsider, born in the small, remote town of Invercargill, New Zealand
(a town that also happens to be one of the southern-most cities in world). "I
am a child of the Southern Cross," he writes in *Philosophy of Power*, "and I
have no preordained respect for geniuses born under the Northern
constellations" [@murray_philosophy_1939, 51].

[^ln3-swedenborg]: See @swedenborg_treatise_1778, regarding the "gross error of
those who assert the materiality of the soul, affirming it to be homogeneous,
and continuous with the body; whereas it is heterogeneous, and discrete" (24).
Swedenborg gives the neoplatonic, monistic articulation of the matter to the
angels, in the "Angelic Idea of Creation," writing, "The question was asked,
'Whence, then, is hell?' They said, 'From man's freedom, without which a man
would not be a man,' because man, from that freedom, broke the continuity in
himself; and this being broken, separation took place; and the continuity,
which was in him from creation, became like a chain, or a piece of linked
work, which falls to pieces when the hooks above are broken or torn out, and
then hangs down from small threads. Separation or rupture was brought about,
and is brought about, by the denial of God" [@swedenborg_apocalypse_1901, 290].

[^ln3-golumbia]: See @golumbia_cultural_2009: "Following a line of criticism
that extends at least as farm back as Kant [...] (loc. 63)." Paraphrasing
@deleuze_postscript_1992, Golumbia writes "To submit a phenomenon to
computation is to striate otherwise-smooth details, among details, to push
upwards towards the sovereign, to make only high-level control available to
the user and then only those aspects of control that are deemed appropriate to
the sovereign (loc. 159)." To make sense of the contemporary unease with
digitization, we will first examine some of the material contexts that support
the propagation of digital media. We will then look at a few formal,
theoretical attempts to describe the particularity of digital representation.
Finally, we will have the chance to examine the specifics by which digital
media necessitates a change in the "mode" of specifically digital
apprehension.

discrete vs. continuous multiplicities in Bergsonian thought see also
