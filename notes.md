## Questions

- How does listening happen? Is it congruent with the scholarly exegesis.
- Technique vs. genre vs. materiality
- Can we borrow the segmented distributed into the digital realm

## Notes
How are texts constituted?

Diffusion of literacy. New reading publics. Vast zone where orality and
literacy interpenetrate. Laboratory of investigation!

1. Text (oral and written configurations! of words). A tissue of words.
Emergent quality of oral arts: collaboration, dialogic, multi-modality. Early
on--there is nothing "fixed" about oral culture. Focus rather than structure,
emergence vs. fixity. BUT what about the intentions of oral performance.
Projecting forms forward.

The key to con-textualization: the words are no longer mine. Lack of interest
in others interpretation destroys meaning.

2. African praise poetry, attributes of. Vocative. Activate. The being comes
into existence. But also baffling to outside interpreters, who understood them
as "deliberately obfuscating." The observation signal an aesthetic preference.
Obscurity demands exegesis. Exegesis requires specialized knowledge. THE
MEANING IS NOT IMPLICIT, IT IS EXTERNAL TO THE TEXT.

The narrator moves from one topic to another. The story does not explicitly
connect the episodic events. What do they mean, the anthropologist asks. The
narrator says you have to ask in the village where the story if from. The text
needed a subtext for understanding. Mnemonic triggers in the narration, which
needed to be unpacked.

Distributed text! [Distributed cognition!] Segmentation! Each component of the
text had to be understood by different towns.

This connected to the structure of the town. You HAD to have a diverse
composition. You want an assemblage of interpretation.

3. Techniques of decipherment. Listeners come up with their own
interpretations. The interpretations are different, but each internally
cohesive and analytical.

4. What happens when this way of narration meets book culture? A community
that was actively seeking to constitute a public sphere. In the process of
standardization of alphabet meaning gets fixed? Is the duality of meaning
still possible? Histories of town begin to get published. Instead of
distributed textuality you have a centralized record. The segmented character
of oral production has been reversed! Now the whole thing is available. The
texts are next to each other, but no mutually formative.

Another interpreter thought there was secret knowledge involved. The oral
tellers are afraid to divulge information for fear.

The elite printers wanted to constitute a public sphere in the sense of
Habermas, which is a different political order from the distributed village
system [as far as I understand].

The texts LIE THERE LIKE UNDETONATED SHELLS.

Ingenious exegesis! Different audiences. Professional praise singers, who do
collect all the stories. Not herm. sealed. People visible inflating. The role
of a researcher. One atom among many. That world is not pristine!
