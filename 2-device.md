## Chapter 2: Laying Bare the Device (The Modernist Roots of Computation)

"The weakest point in our present day universe is the incapacity of man to
meet the machine, the culture conserve, or the robot, other than through
submission, actual destruction, and social revolution" [@moreno_who_1953,
233]. So wrote the Austrian-American psychiatrist, Jacob L. Moreno between the
years of 1934 and 1953, in his idiosyncratic, sprawling, and now seldom read
volume, *Who Shall Survive?* He is remembered today as a pioneer of group
therapy and an early critic of Freud and socialism. Sociologists have also
recently rediscovered his work as precursor to network analysis. His books
contain beautiful diagrams, sprouting nodes and edges, with titles like
"Structure of a Cottage Family," "A Handicraft Group," and "The Civilian
Social Atom." Moreno was also a humanist and a philosopher of technology and
culture. In opposition to eugenics, popular at the time, his answer to "Who
Shall Survive?" was "everyone" [@moreno_who_1953, 245].

Humanity, according to Moreno, faces two major threats: first embodied in the
aggression from other human beings, and second, in the aggression of robots
or, what Moreno alternatively calls the "cultural conserve" and the
"zootechnical animal" [@moreno_who_1953, 237]. Robots for Moreno encompass all
devices, social structures, and products of the mind that diminish creativity.
With time, "technical devices" and the "methods in the making of cultural
products" are inherited and "used with less friction." For Moreno, technology
is first and foremost a labor-saving device and creativity the single most
important kind of labor. When the effort of creativity is diminished
significantly, humans begin to "neglect and abandon the genuine and
outstanding creative process." The robot leads to the extinguishing of "all
the active, living moments," striving towards the "illusion of the finished,
perfected product" [@moreno_who_1953, 233]. This illusion reduces humans to
"machine-addicts," residing in a "jungle of robots" that threatens to
suffocate all spontaneous activity. Through robots, life then becomes a
script.

In the name of comfort, safety, and prolonged life, technocracy disempowers
the very subjects whose lives it claims to preserve. The zootechnical animal
exchanges the human capacity for self-determination for the promised certainty
of a better future. Moreno writes:

> The eugenic dreamer and the technological dreamer have one idea in common to
substitute and hasten the slow process of nature. Once the creative process is
encapsulated in a book it is *given*; it can be recapitulated eternally by
everybody without the effort of creating anew.  Once a machine for a certain
pattern of performance is invented a certain produce can be turned out in
infinite numbers practically without effort [...] Once that miraculous eugenic
formula will be found a human society will be given prefect and smooth at
birth, like a book off a press [@moreno_who_1953, 236].

Like king Thamus from Plato's *Phaedrus*, Moreno distrusts rote mechanization
of thought itself. All forms of displaced agency fall under suspicion: the
plow, the pen, the book, the typewriter, the gun, the rocket, and the atomic
bomb, radio and television, central planning, corporate governance, and legal
codex [@moreno_who_1953, 237-44]. Contrary to my intuitions, this list places
both books and bombs at the same level of analysis. For Moreno, both
instruments are similar in that they embody a detached form of agency. They
both seem to act on their own accord. With time, volition so detached and
mechanized begins to govern without consensus or comprehension. Splintered
from its source, the robot staggers forth, *golem*-like, through books, laws,
and social institutions. Near immortal, images of the past proliferate and
crowd out the present. Moreno writes:

> Once off the press, the parent, the producer, the author is immaterial; the
> book goes to all places and to all people, it does not care where it is read
> and by whom. Many robots have further in common the attribute of comparative
> immortality. A book, a film, an atomic bomb, they do not perish in the human
> sense, the same capacity is always there, they can be reproduced *ad
> infinitum* [...] Our human world is increasingly filled with robots and there
> seems to be no end to new forms and new developments [@moreno_who_1953, 239].

In the aftermath of World War II, Moreno expanded the first edition of his
book to consider the ultimate automaton, the atomic bomb. "Mankind has been
awakened from a dream," he writes. The atomic bomb gives humanity a glimpse of
its common enemy. A mindless agent in possession of detached human volition,
it competes with living actors for survival. Once in motion, robots---books
and bombs---continue to do their bidding blindly. They survive and continue to
shape the social and the mental worlds to come. Moreno explains:

> Many of the domesticated robots are blessed with the attribute of becoming
labor-saving devices, which has, however the unpleasant consequence that they
at times reduce the need for creating, promoting with leisure also inertia.
[...] Many of the robots have also the attribute in common of being able to
affect human beings or other "targets at a distance," a book, a radio or a
television sender can entertain or teach at a distance, like a gun, a rocket
and an atomic bomb can kill people and destroy at a distance. The book is a
robot par excellence [@moreno_who_1953, 238].

For Moreno, the inertia of past decisions embodied in extant mechanisms
ultimately poses a threat for human survival. In this view, the real
competition for survival happens not between persons, sects, races, or
nations, but between humanity and its automatons. To compete with the robot
humans must expand their capacity for creation. Creative spontaneity is the
one advantage they have over the zootechnical animal. The robot responds with
repetition, leading to indolence. It eases the burden of creativity, weakening
the capacity for poiesis. Moreno's therapy practice was therefore based on the
principle of creative spontaneity training, or "psychodrama," aimed at the
construction of communities that acknowledge and preserve a sense of personal
agency. As far as I can tell from the records, the practice involved group
improvisation and role-play, in what Moreno called the "techniques of freedom"
[@moreno_who_1953, 8].

Moreno's jarring parallelism between books and bombs reminds the reader that
both constitute a species of displaced agency, a problem long in the
background of Western liberal thought.[^ln1-consensus] Both represent agency
delayed in time and space. The projectile acts at a distance; once launched,
it will complete its grim mandate even if the command to act is withdrawn.
Technology of the word similarly decouples readers from writers. The book
persists to mean in the absence of the author. Once decoupled, seemingly
autonomous agents---books, folders, documents---clutter the social sphere,
continuing to structure human experience in the absence of the originating
accord. The above might appear a curious way of putting things, but not
unusual in the larger context of post-Kantian humanism at the turn of the
twentieth century. In Moreno's words we hear more than an echo of Marx's
fetishism of commodities, by which "definite social relation between men"
assumes "the fantastic form of a relation between things" [@marx_capital_1967,
72]. Moreno arrives at a similar conclusion by another logic. In creating some
of the earliest examples of social network graphs, he finds (and objects to)
the presence of things in the position of social actors.

Moreno helps us see the book in a new light. If it was always, as he
suggested, a robot for enacting action at a distance, it is all the more
robotic as a device that draws electricity, an electronic book. When in the
1930s one could view Moreno's rhetoric about books and bombs as a
fanciful---technophobic even---view of literary technology, a century later
his concern appears pressing and prescient. The unintended consequences of
automated and disembodied agency, from artificially intelligent personal
assistants to market trading algorithms, worry scientists, legislators, and
philosophers. What looks like a book today indeed takes on the functions of a
gun and a trigger. Electronic books distributed on mobile phones, tablets, and
personal computers comprise a part of the same digital infrastructure that
powers drones and aircraft carriers. Today, computers in the service of the
world's largest purveyors of literature are also used by air traffic control
and covert intelligence agencies [@soyata_combat:_2012;
@logicworks_government_2015]. The small computer in your pocket can also be
used both to read books and to detonate explosives.

These conditions compel us---historians, philologists, et al.---to reconsider
the cozy relationship we have had with books since the advent of the Gutenberg
press. Simulated text no longer plays by the same rules as print. The
bibliographic illusion veils machine internals. My task in this chapter will
be to illuminate the blueprint of computation within the electronic book. In a
reciprocal movement, I aim also to place the modern computer itself within the
long history of the book, as a piece of literary (and not just mathematical)
technology. To achieve these tasks, I will construct a short prehistory of the
literary device, based on materials roughly from the first half of the
twentieth century. I am interested in the simultaneous emergence of the
literary device as formal technique, a series of thought experiments, and
finally as an instrument that lies at the modernist foundations of
contemporary computational culture. These material and intellectual
genealogies will help reveal the electronic book as a device and to bring it
back under the purview of interpretation.

[^ln1-auto]: See for example @heidegger_pathmarks_1998, 57: "For the phenomenon
most worthy of thought and questioning remains the mystery of
language---wherein our entire reflection has to gather itself---above all when
it dawns on us that language is not a work of human beings: language speaks."
See also @blanchot_work_1995, 41.

[^ln1-consensus]: The literature on consensual governance, for example, going
back to Hobbes, Locke, and Mill, often touches on the problem of lapsed
consent. To paraphrase, they ask: What makes whatever compacts made by past
generations still valid today?

### 2.1 Technique / Technics

What kind of a *thing* is a literary *device*? The formal concept of a device,
used widely in literary studies, is in part an artifact of an unfortunate
translation from the Russian *priem*. The word would be better translated as
"technique," in the sense of "method," "approach," or "procedure." Device
contains these meanings as well, but in modern usage, it often carries a more
concrete connotation, as "an object, machine, or piece of equipment that has
been made for a special purpose" [@_device_2016]. "Laying bare the device,"
for Viktor Shklovsky, the Russian formalist critic who coined the phrase at
the turn of the century, meant making explicit the implied mechanisms of
literary trope, particularly in cases where such tropes turn "stale,"
"automatic," and "naturalized," that is, bereft of their original poetic and
evocative power [@shklovsky_voskreshenie_1914; @shklovksy_poetika_1919;
@shklovksy_art_2012].[^ln2-shklov]

Vladimir Nabokov, a writer conspicuously aware of his literary--theoretical
heritage, used the formal technique of "laying bare the device" often and with
relentless clinical precision. In the short story "A Guide to Berlin," to
which D. Barton Johnson attributes our first glimpse at Nabokov's "mature
virtuoso style," Nabokov writes:

> In front of the house where I live, a gigantic black pipe lies along the
outer edge of the sidewalk. A couple of feet away, in the same file, lies
another, then a third and a fourth---the street's iron entrails, still idle,
not yet lowered into the ground, deep under the asphalt. For the first few
days after they were unloaded, with a hollow clanging, from trucks, little
boys would run on them, up and down, and crawl on all fours through those
round tunnels, but a week later nobody was playing anymore and thick snow was
falling instead; and now when, cautiously probing the treacherous glaze of the
sidewalk with my thick rubber-heeled stick, I go out in the flat gray light of
the morning, an even stripe of fresh snow stretches along the upper side of
each black pipe [...] Today someone wrote "Otto" with his finger on the strip
of virgin snow, and I thought how beautifully that name, with its two soft o's
flanking the pair of gentle consonants suited the silent layer of snow upon
that pipe with its two orifices and its tacit tunnel [@nabokov_guide_1976, 27;
@johnson_guide_1979, 354].

This tightly wound vignette takes the formalist programmatic concern with
"laying bare the device" to its logical conclusion. The pipes can be read as a
metaphor for a literary device. Usually found beneath the street, they now sit
idle and visible above the surface. Yet even when exposed, the device fails to
captivate for long. Disused, it once again passes out of sight, covered in
snow. Concerned with surfaces, the narrator "probes the glaze" of the street
and finds a palindrome written in snow. The inscription "OTTO" not only
resembles the pipes visually, but is in itself a surface-revealing inscription
that makes the pipes visible again. Although the metaphoric pipe does not
reach beyond the page, the mimetic surface inscription draws attention to the
word's visual shape and acoustics. It invites readers to perform the symmetry
of its assonance and consonance as they pronounce the word. The round vowels
and the interrupting obstruents of "OTTO" contort the body in accordance with
the sound image: reverse mimesis, the body as sound pipe. The moment of
corporeal reenactment transcends the representational and paper-bound confines
of the medium. The performance makes the "making of the literary technique
obvious," obvious. Nabokov exposes the metaphor implicit in the very idea of
"laying bare the device." In this, lies the prevalent characteristic of
Nabokov's mature work, which often seeks to transcend the diegetic, fictional
world through sheer recursion of literary technique, where each successive
turn of abstraction brings the buried symbol closer to the reader.

Despite such emphasis on laying bare the device, formalist poetics (both in
art and in scholarship) fell short of producing an explicit theory of
technique. In his "Art as Device," Shklovsky writes:

> The work of poetic schools amounts to the aggregation and the discovery of
> new devices/techniques [*priem*] for the arrangement and the processing of
> linguistic material, and, in particular, more so with the rearrangement of
> figure [*obraz*] rather than with its creation" [@shklovksy_poetika_1919,
> 102].

Responding to a previous generation of symbolist poets who placed emphasis on
the creation of new tropes, Shklovsky and his fellow travellers privileged the
innovative "arrangement and the processing" of language material. The
formalists did not want to reduce poetics to a type of figurative, symbolic
thinking. They understood art in terms of device and technique rather than in
terms of meaning or content, as it was for the symbolists. For them, to write
literature meant not merely to speak in figurative language, but to invent new
linguistic forms capable of cutting across prosaic and habituated norms of
speaking [@shklovksy_poetika_1919, 103]. In this, Shklovsky held innovation at
a premium, falling short however of defining its device. The device seems to
be simply any trope capable of disrupting habituated experience. Depending on
their arrangement, conventional tropes like synecdoche, parallelism, and are
capable of producing the effect of either poetic innovation or prosaic
commonplace.

Thus even as formal analysis skirted the idea of a materialist poetics, the
formalists stopped short of encountering the trope as a thing. For this
reason, it is interesting to consider Nabokov's recursive meta-poetics as a
logical conclusion of the formalist program. Nabokov's pipes and surface
inscriptions protrude through the diegetic limits of the fictional world,
pointing to the book as an object. The nesting doll structure of literary
instrumentation ends at the book. Nabokov's prose reveals the surface of the
page as the outer-most literary device containing all other literary devices.
But, despite its materialist ambitions, formal literary analysis can only
gesture towards the object. Technique remains an intra-textual procedure. The
material affordances of the literary object are not seen as participating in
the dynamics of meaning making. The book itself recedes from view. The English
critic Percy Lubbock, himself a formalist of sorts, would write echoing his
Soviet colleagues:

> To grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of the book, to hold it fast, to
> turn it over and to survey it at leisure---that is the effort of a critic of
> books, and it is perpetually defeated [...] Nothing, no power, will keep the
> book steady and motionless before us so that we may have time to examine its
> shape and design [@lubbock_craft_1921, 1].

The book continually escapes the reader's grasp. Our ability to understand the
novel as a form is hampered by our unfamiliarity with its "technical aspects,"
Lubbock writes in the conclusion of his influential *The Craft of Fiction"
[@lubbock_craft_1921, 272]. Other more plastic art forms like sculpture or
painting can be grasped at once, in their entirety. They exist at a time and
at a place limited to their physical dimensions. By contrast, the narrative
unfolds in time. The novel must be assembled before the mind's eye to present
itself for analysis in its entirety. Elements of composition unfold in time
outside of the novel's physical, bibliographic contexts. Meaning making of
this sort involves reading past the linguistic minutiae to construct a
synthetic literary whole. Lubbock writes that the "real heart and substance of
the book [...] stands out more clearly for the obscurity into which the less
essential parts of it subside" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 4]. To read in this mode
is to deny the book its materiality. To read the novel for pleasure is to
"forget, if we can, that the book is an object of art [@lubbock_craft_1921,
6]. And to forget the book as an object of art is necessarily to forget it
also as an object. Thus to "objectify the elements" of the novel that "strike
us more keenly," as Lubbock phrases it, is precisely the opposite of what is
normally meant by objectification. Reading is a retreat from materiality. The
book is a retreat also from the material realities of the reader's immediate
context, an escape into the imagination, where the reader can "discover a
world" and "be lost" in a "pleasant illusion," where there is "no chance of
our finding, perceiving, recreating, the *form* of the book [emphasis mine]"
[@lubbock_craft_1921, 6].

Unlike the lay reader, the critic's task is to engage in the particulates of
the writing craft. Lubbock writes that "far from losing ourselves in the world
of the novel, we must hold it away from us, see it all in detachment, and use
the whole of it to make the image we seek, the book itself"
[@lubbock_craft_1921, 6]. Echoing Boris Eichenbaum in "How *The Overcoat* is
Made", Lubbock calls the reader's attention to the technology of literary
construction. He promises to view a "handful of familiar novels [...] with
some particularity," but without judgement or critique. "How they are made is
the only question I ask," he writes [@shklovksy_poetika_1919;
@lubbock_craft_1921, 12 & 28; @eichenbaum_how_1995]. "The author of the book
was a craftsman," it is therefore the critic's role to "overtake him at his
work and see how the book was made" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 274]. Lubbock's
usage of a seemingly materialist vocabulary---"parts," "forms," "shapes,"
"proportions," and "designs"---nevertheless refer to ideational, mental
constructs, just as it was for Shklovsky and Eichenbaum. "The book vanishes as
we lay our hands on it," Lubbock writes [@lubbock_craft_1921, 273]. Critics
must chose to see either the trees or the forest. As the totality of the work
comes into view, the technical details of craft disappear. Viewed up close,
the technical details obscure sight of the work as a whole. *The Craft of
Fiction* ends on an ambivalent note, stopping short of recovering the book as
an object. "If only there was one single tangible and measurable fact about
the book," Lubbock writes. If only it could be "weighed like a statue" or
"measured like a picture, it would be a support in the world of shadows
[@lubbock_craft_1921, 273-4].

Walter Benjamin, writing in the 1930s, was one of the first to define the
notion of literary technique in a way that would connect it to a materialist
poetics. The work of art for Benjamin does not and cannot exist in the mode of
a "rigid, isolated object." Rather, "it must be inserted into the context of
living social relations," and therefore, into the context determined by its
relation to literary production [@benjamin_author_1983, 87]. Authorship
identifies a specific mode of production. The question of formal,
intra-textual figurative arrangements within the work of art thus cannot be
considered apart from their extra-textual material contexts. Technique for
Benjamin is what makes literary products "accessible" to materialist analysis;
technique *is* in itself, in his view, a relationship to production
[@benjamin_author_1983, 87].

In making the characteristically Marxist move towards the idea of production,
Benjamin attempts to bridge what he calls "the sterile dichotomy" between form
and content [@benjamin_author_1983, 88]. The concept of technique brings the
arrangement of literary, ideational content into accordance with its material
context. By these means the very concept of the author---what counts for
authorship, what is published---connects to the overall structure of the
publishing industry and the industry to the more general arrangements of labor
and capital. In this way the *idea* of citizen reporters, to take a Soviet
example that he uses, has the potential to democratize journalism. But, as
long as the production of newspapers is outside of the writer's immediate
control, citizen journalism is bound to remain, *in practice*, "an article of
consumption." Forces of capital ultimately transform the potential for any
meaningful political struggle brought about by the new narrative technique
into mere comfortable contemplation, a technically perfect object of enjoyment
[@benjamin_author_1983].

It seems not possible then for poetic form to evolve without the corresponding
evolution in the structures of literary production. Like Shklovsky, Benjamin
saw a small ray of hope in modernist techniques of estrangement and
interruption. Emerging art forms like photo-montage and the epic theater
puncture the illusion of artistic unity. "Epic theater does not reproduce
conditions," Benjamin writes; it is not mimetic, it "discloses" and
"uncovers." The technique of interruption, by which a playwright freezes the
scene, for example, functions to create a caesura within the structure of the
play. Similar to Lubbock's detached objectification of the novel and
Shklovsky's concept of estrangement, interruption brings attention to the
artifice of the art form. At the height of its powers, epic drama shows the
possibility of what Benjamin calls a "lasting alienation," by which the
effects of the dramatic interruption can persevere beyond theater, continuing
to expose the uncomfortable truths about the human condition
[@benjamin_author_1983, 99-102].

In traditional Marxist terms, the dilemma of robotics---automated machinery of
thought and war---rests on an understanding of production as it relates to its
cognates: authorship, technique, craft, poiesis. Even in those cases when
authors write freely, without duress, they do not chose their instruments.
Readers also determine the contexts of their own meaning making only in part.
"The means of production do not depend on the free will," Marx wrote
[@marx_collected_1976, 181; @winner_autonomous_1978, 83]. It is not enough
therefore to be an independent supplier of commodities, a free agent. One must
also be free to develop new *ways of producing*. The liberated writer must
transform, in Benjamin's words, from the "supplier" of technique into an
"engineer," able to adapt the literary apparatus towards one's own ends
[@benjamin_author_1983, 102].

Материальная эстетика, изолирующая в культуре не только искусство,
но и отдельные искусства и берущая произведение не в его художественной жизни,
а как вещь, как организованный материал, в лучшем случае способна обосновать
лишь хронологическую таблицу изменений приемов техники данного искусства, ибо
изолированная техника вообще не может иметь историю.  [Bakthin 1, 280-1]

Отсюда отнюдь не следует, что в эстетике изучение материальной структуры
произведения, как чисто технической, должно занять скромное место. Значение
материальных исследований в специальной эстетике чрезвычайно велико, так же
велико, как и значение материального произведения и его созидания для
художника и для эстетического созерцания. Мы вполне можем присоединиться к
утверждению: «техника в искусстве все», понимая его в том смысле, что
эстетический объект осуществляется только путем создания материального
произведения (эстетическое видение вне искусства потому и гибридно, что здесь
недостижима сколько-нибудь совершенная организация материала, например, — при
созерцании природы); до этого создания и независимо от него он не существует,
он осуществляется впервые вместе с произведением[564].
    Не нужно придавать слову «техника» в применении к художественному
творчеству какое-то одиозное значение: техника здесь не может и не должна
отрываться от эстетического объекта, им она оживлена и движима во всех своих
моментах, поэтому в художественном творчестве техника отнюдь не механистична,
механистической она может представиться лишь в дурном эстетическом
исследовании, которое теряет эстетический объект, делает технику самодовлеющей
и отрывает ее от цели и смысла. В противовес подобным исследованиям и должно
подчеркивать служебный характер материальной организации произведения, ее
чисто технический характер не для того, чтобы принизить ее, а наоборот, чтобы
осмыслить и оживить [Bakhtin 1, 310].

  Вопрос об отношениях между созерцателем и творцом впервые поставили не
лефисты. Он стар, как мир, и не может быть выражен в одной формуле; для
каждого направления она особая. Но приблизительно можно сказать так:
созерцатель равен творцу минус техника. Компетентный созерцатель стремится
сотворить в себе авторский процесс за исключением технического процесса,
который для эстетической оценки ему воспроизводить не обязательно. Так что
общая формула отношений между творцом и созерцателем это: творец равен
созерцателю плюс техника{314}. Техника — понятие, имеющее то более широкое, то
более узкое значение в зависимости от рода искусства. Так, в архитектуре
технический процесс громаден. Как художник архитектор создает лишь план, а
затем он действует как инженер. В поэзии, напротив, техника почти ничтожна.
Так что в различных искусствах техника принимает разные величины. Кроме того,
характер отдельного искусства зависит от постановлений школы, к которой оно
примыкает. В XIX веке эстетика преимущественно ориентировалась на созерцателя,
и потому мы не найдем в ней приемов подхода к техническим моментам. Но в конце
XIX и начале XX столетий уже большое внимание уделяется объекту творчества и в
связи с этим и проблемам техники. [Bakhtin 2, 373-4].

Автор направлен на содержание (жизненную, т. е.  познавательно-этическую
напряженность героя), его он формирует и завершает, используя для этого
определенный материал, в нашем случае — словесный, подчиняя этот материал
своему художественному заданию, т. е. заданию завершить данное
познавательно-этическое напряжение. Исходя из этого, можно различать в
художественном произведении или, точнее, в данном художественном задании три
момента: содержание, материал, форма. Форма не может быть понята независимо от
содержания, но не может быть независима и от природы материала и обусловленных
ею приемов. Форма обусловлена данным содержанием, с одной, и особенностью
материала и способами его обработки — с другой стороны. Чисто материальное
художественное задание — технический эксперимент. Художественный прием не
может быть только приемом обработки словесного материала (лингвистической
данности слов), он должен быть прежде всего приемом обработки определенного
содержания, но при этом — с помощью определенного материала. Наивно было бы
представлять себе, что художнику нужен один только язык и знание приемов
обращения с ним, а этот язык он получает именно как язык — не больше, т. е. от
лингвиста (ибо только лингвист имеет дело с языком, как с языком); и этот язык
и вдохновляет художника, и он выполняет на нем все возможные задания, не
выходя за пределы его — как языка только, как-то: задание семасиологическое,
фонетическое, синтаксическое и пр. Действительно, язык обрабатывает художник,
но не как язык, как язык он его преодолевает, ибо он не должен восприниматься
— как язык в его лингвистической определенности[412] (морфологической,
синтаксической, лексикологической и пр.), и лишь постольку он становится
средством художественного выражения. (Слово должно перестать ощущаться как
слово). Поэт творит не в мире языка, языком он лишь пользуется [bakhtin 1,
249]. 

At this point, it becomes productive to connect the idea of literary technique
to the notion of technics, as developed in the intellectual lineage of Marxist
sociology and anthropology, and, later, in media theory and in science and
technology studies. I differentiate between the two terms orthographically
purely as a matter of convenience to identify parallel ideas, developed in
different fields but arriving at similar conclusions. The very notion of
technique and technics brings to mind at least these three distinct
contemporary scholarly traditions: literary analysis, through the notion of
technique in formalist criticism; Germanophone media theory through the
concept of *Kulturtechniken* in the work of scholars Friedrich Kittler,
Bernhard Siegert, and Cornelia Vismann; and finally the American school of
science and technology studies as exemplified by the work of Lewis Mumford and
Langdon Winner.

Like Benjamin's technique, technics---the patterns of
making---are a given. They exist a priori, embodied by received technology.
Langdon Winner, whose

### 2.2 Thought Experiment

To confront the computer as a *literary* device, optimized for symbolic
exchange, one must first understand its peculiar relationship to universal
Turing machines. And to understand the history of Turing machines, it is best
we view them in a wider cultural context, beyond the mathematical literature
where they were first introduced. I would like to take some time now to draw
two as yet unexplored lineages that lead to Turing's seminal essay on
computable numbers: the first intellectual, stemming back to his tutelage
under Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the second material, highlighting the physical
similarities between Turing's design and a number of concomitant developments
in printing and communication. To read Turing and Wittgenstein together is to
recover a legacy of humanities computing that often gets overlooked in the
critical literature on the subject. This history is important because it
allows us to see the simulated book in a new light: not as byproduct of
quantification, but as a metaphor machine, capable of universal symbolic
manipulation.

Turing machines should hold interest for literary scholars because they
present a minimally viable model for generalized symbolic manipulation:
reading and writing. Although the thought experiment they embody solves a
mathematical problem, the thought experiment itself has roots in a more
general discussion about the nature of interpretation, central to questions of
meaning-making in art and culture.

In his seminal 1936 paper on computable numbers, Alan Turing, then a student
at King's College, proposed a peculiar thought experiment to appear on the
pages of mathematical journal. The experiment addressed a problem in the field
of elementary number theory. But the problem turned out to be less important
than the general shape of the solution.[^ln1-anticipate] Turing imagined a
mechanism that solves a theoretical problem. His solution thus touched upon
not just the theory of mathematics, but on the *action* of symbolic thought in
the world.  His imagined machine could read, write, and in some sense,
understand symbols.  In other words, it was able to transition from some form
of representational, external shape of the symbol into the corresponding
non-representational internal state of the mechanism. The outlines of that
mechanism will come into focus in his section.[^ln1-turingcog]

Let us be clear about one point at the outset: Turing did not "invent" the
computer. Rather I see his hypothetical machine as the culmination of a
long-standing thought experiment concerning the nature of interpretation,
passed to him through Wittgenstein's lectures. It presents a minimally viable
blueprint for a class of already existing devices, used for communication and
control. Turing's minimally viable schematics gave a succinct formula to what
we now call simply "programming" and "computers."

Consider the essence of programming devices as a practice related to the
general deferment of volition by symbolic means, as in "last will and
testament" or a to-do list or a legal injunction. Someone wants you to do
something: turn left then right, buy milk, invest into real estate, or, in the
case of literature, feel compassion. Machines can be thought of as an
extension of that same practice. To "program" a rudimentary toaster, for
example, is to displace some measure of volition (I want toast) to an
inanimate object. Should I die in the process of toast-making, the toaster
will still carry the action of making toast to its logical conclusion. Common
to all of these examples is a lengthening of the cause an effect chain. Under
regular circumstances, the desire to do something produces an immediate
corresponding action in the world.  You reach for an apple. You take a bite.
"Programming" in that sense delays the execution of desire. I want toast now,
but I will program a toaster to make it tomorrow. The toaster acts as an
executor of my will.

In Moreno's language, we could say that a programmed machine symbolizes that
"conserved" fraction of the will to do something. It represents and enacts the
originating desire, able to continue performing an action independently, in
the absence of the "programmer." In that way the machine could be said to
"conserve" volition. Delay and displacement of that sort resides at the center
of humanity's unease with automata, robotics, and computation. The worry is
not only that the machine will begin to act independently---the plot of many a
science fiction novel---but that it will continue acting without cessation.
Note however that such remote volitional properties are not confined to the
autonomous movement of a mechanism. Moreno's initially disconcerting
proposition to treat books and robots on the same plane of analysis makes
sense if viewed in the context of---what should we call it?---history of
symbolism and representation.

The problem of symbolic displacement already presents itself in the invention
of writing. Recall for example the famous *pharmakon* passage from Plato's
*Phaedrus*, discussed eloquently in Jacques Derrida's *Dissemination*. At the
conclusion of the dialog, King Thamus objects to the technology (*ta tekhnēs*)
of the written word, as he believes it will foster forgetfulness in the people
who use it.  Plato writes: "Their faith in extrinsic writing [*graphō
exōthen*], by means of foreign impressions [*allotrion tupōn*] will diminish
their intrinsic [*endothen autous*] capacity to remember"
[@plato_plato:_1999].[^ln1-platotr] Plato thus contrasts the exterior figure
[*graphō exōthen*] with the intrinsic [*endothen*] human capacity to remember.
The Greek *tupōn*, related to the English "type," literally means an
impression. And in this case it is "foreign" or "othered" [*allotrion*].  It
comes from without. Like Moreno after him, Thamus finds such remote thought
typography problematic. True memory and thought for them both must come from
within. It must be autopoietic not allopoietic. This is why Socrates asks
Phaedrus to stop reciting a speech the young man heard earlier and memorized.
Mechanical reproduction by rote does not in any sense equate to what we would
today call "critical thinking." To truly understand, the reader must properly
internalize a stream of symbolic information contained in a book or a speech.
As we shall see, much can go wrong in that process, but we expect for reading
to ultimately leave an appropriate impression [*tupōn*] on the reader's mental
state. But what is appropriate or proper?  Wittgenstein struggles to answer
that question in his lectures, where Turing machine enacts it with blunt
force.  The Turing machine ingests symbols, incorporating them as part of its
internal structure.

I revisit the lines from Plato's well-worn dialogue because Turing's paper
presents considerable difficulties to the non-mathematically-inclined reader.
Yet it becomes more accessible when considered in the philosophic lineage of
Plato, Wittgenstein, and Derrida: all three concerned with the movement of
inscription between internal and external spaces. I want us to view computers
and programming not only as products of electrical engineering but also as
part of a persistent thought in Western culture about the ultimate relation
between symbol and comprehension.

What does it mean to understand a sign?---that is the larger question that
Turing addresses. And, as we will see in the following passages, a direct
connection exists between Wittgenstein's hermeneutics and Turing's ideas about
computation. Steeped in the intellectual context of Cambridge, the evolution
of their thought overlaps the search for intrinsic structure in fields as
diverse as literary studies and anthropology. Turing's ideas about symbolic
manipulation acquire a new meaning when considered against the background of
formalism and structuralism, developing in Europe at the same time.

It is precisely because Turing paper left so much non-mathematical residue in
the wake of its publication that it continues to be a source of debate,
misunderstanding, and controversy to the present day. Consider the following
attempts to describe the essence of Turing computation:

> Turing machine, n. A notional computing machine for performing simple
> reading, writing, and shifting operations in accordance with a prescribed
> set of rules, invoked in theories of computability and automata
[@_turing_2015].

> a criterion [...] that it shall be possible to to devise a computing
> machine, occupying a finite space, and with working parts of finite size
[@church_computable_1937, 42].

> a human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit
> instructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine
[@church_computable_1937, 43].

> To understand a Turing machine we need only know its table of commands
[@kemeny_man_1955].

> A Turing machine plus random elements is a reasonable model for the human
> brain 
[@putnam_issues_1961, 39].

> No Turing machine has ever been physically constructed or realized in
> hardware as a device for its own sake, but general-purpose digital computers
> have been programmed to simulate Turing machines
[@jordain_condensed_1969, 550; @_turing_2015].

In reading the above passages, one discovers a range of possible definitions.
The *Oxford English Dictionary* discusses Turing's original experiment in
terms of "a notational machine." It "performs operations" according to "a
prescribed set of rules." In short, the machine at least seems like a machine,
not unlike a steam engine or a mechanized doll. By contrast, Alonzo Church,
who was one of the first to read and to respond to Turing's paper, describes
it as a "criterion" for building a machine, not the machine itself. More
confusingly, it seems that a human armed with a pen and paper can already
satisfy Turing's criteria. Writing for the *Scientific American* in the
fifties, John Kemeny likens it to a "table of commands." In his reflection, it
seems neither a device nor a human being but an algorithm or a set of
instructions. A decade later, Hilary Putnam (along with a number of prominent
philosophers of mind) returns to Turing's paper to find a model of human
cognition.[@fodor_language_1975; @putnam_representation_1988]. Writing for one
of the earliest encyclopedias on computing, Philip Jordain finally
encapsulates the paradox at the heart of Turing computation: it is a device
that can never be constructed, yet all other computers are programmed in its
image.

A mechanism, an idea, an algorithm---imitating a human or imitated by
humans---an impossible ideal or just a ordinary person holding a pencil, the
Turing machine traces a figure somewhere between the ideal and the physical
worlds. The indeterminacy of computation blurs the boundaries between the
physical and the symbolic worlds. Turing continues to strike a controversial
figure at the fault lines separating theory from practice: computer science
and electrical engineering. The Turing machine "abstracts away from the
complexity of real computer architectures," Thomas Haigh writes for the
*Communications of Computing Machinery*. The historian should avoid confusing
hardware and software, he concludes [@haigh_actually_2014]. No matter how hard
computer science tries to escape into the realm of pure mathematics, Haigh
suggests, the limits of physical engineering pull it back to the sphere of the
applied.[^ln1-cs] Part real mechanism and part dream; part physics and part
metaphysics, the Turing machine should be encountered on its own terms. Let us
take the moment to read the paper and to place it into the intellectual
context of the development of Turing's thought.

Turing begins his paper suggestively: "we may compare a man in the process of
computing a real number to a machine that is only capable of a finite number
of conditions." [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. In effect, he asks his readers
to compare computation, a human mental process, to the mechanical action of a
machine. As Charles Petzold explained it in his book-length annotation on
Turing's paper, Turing "makes reference to 'states of mind' that are analogous
to machine states" [@petzold_annotated_2008, 67]. But the analogy itself leads
to contention. Neither mathematicians nor cognitive scientists agree on the
extent to which states of mind can be compared to discrete machine states.

Turing further imagines a machine "supplied with a 'tape' (the analogue of
paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called 'squares') each
capable of bearing a 'symbol'" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. Much like a
movie reel, the tape moves through the mechanism one section at a time. At
each point only one section bearing one symbol can be said to be "in the
machine." "We may call this square the 'scanned square,'" Turing writes,

> The symbol on the scanned square may be called the "scanned symbol." The
> "scanned symbol" is the only one of which the machine is, so to speak,
> "directly aware" [@turing_computable_1937, 231].

The scanned symbols become a part of the machine's internal configuration. In
Turing's words, "the machine can effectively remember some of the symbols
which it has 'seen' (scanned) previously" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The
machine's "behavior" is therefore determined by its initial configuration (in
the arrangement of tape and scanning apparatus) plus the scanned symbol.

We imagine then a device not unlike a telegraph or a film projector, which
ingests reels of tape. But unlike telegraphs or film projectors, the ingested
symbolic representation becomes effectively, by definition, a part of the
machine's internal configuration. Remember that in constructing his
contraption, Turing continually appeals to the model of human cognition. A
child in the process of reading or doing mathematics similarly "ingests"
symbols.  These symbols really do become a part of the child's mental
apparatus, affecting a change in brain states on some real and empirically
observable neurological level. Turing's machine is capable of similar
internalization.

Where the child converts symbol into brain states, the machine transforms
software (symbol) into hardware (configuration). The machine does not just
scan, it "reads" in the Platonic sense, able to convert ideal forms into their
specific instantiations. It becomes "aware," in Turing's words. Consider by
contrast the action of a film projector. Unlike a Turing machine, the
projector does not internalize film reels. The film reel passes through
without leaving a trace within the mechanism.[^ln1-reading]

In addition to "reading," Turing's machine must be able to write. Turing
writes that "in some configurations in which the scanned square is blank
(*i.e.* bears no symbol) the machine writes down a new symbol on the scanned
square" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The machine can also erase and move
symbols to adjacent squares, one square at a time. Reading, writing, and
symbolic manipulation are thus mechanical actions at the core of Turing's
computation.

The configuration state of the machine determines the movement of the
"reading" and "writing" apparatus along the surface of the tape. At its
simplest incarnation, the tape moves along one dimension only: left or right.
Some of the scanned symbols are meant to represent computable numbers (the
whole point of Turing's paper). Yet other symbols represent machine
instructions. They direct the movement of the reading and writing head. They
tell the machine to "write," "scan," or "erase" symbols. Today, we would call
such instructions "programs" or "control codes." The control codes and the
computed data form a part of the same continuous stream of information.

Just as the Turing machine is able to convert symbolic representation into
internal configuration states, it can conversely enact the opposite movement,
by representing internal configuration states symbolically. This remarkable
property allows for the creation of what Turing calls a class of universal
machines. Specific Turing machines could be configured to preform actions like
addition or multiplication. But the multiplication machine could not, for
example, be reconfigured for another purpose, because the physical movement of
its internals is fixed. An adding machine can only add. But the universal
Turing machine can do more than scan symbols: it has the ability to
internalize *other machine configurations*. Such a machine can "compute any
computable sequence" [@turing_computable_1937, 241]. In being able to
internalize physical configuration as symbol, the *universal* Turing machine
can simulate all other special-purpose Turing machines.

The transition of symbols into machine states (and the other way around)
defines modern programming. A universal machine, unlike other, definitive,
single-purpose and limited-state mechanisms (a clock for example), contains
the ability to take on differing internal symbolic configurations. It can
imitate a clock, an abacus, a scale, a book. In a later paper linking
computing machinery and intelligence, Turing implies it could eventually
simulate human thought as well [@turing_computing_1950].[^ln1-compete]

The universal Turing machine (UTM) finally encapsulates a model of computation
itself. The UTM can compute anything computable. In substituting the concept
of computability with "effective computability" Turing's paper belongs to the
annals of mathematical theory. But, it continues to elicit conflicting
responses widely because much of it contains tantalizing possibilities that
bare on symbolic manipulation more generally. The paper is riddled with
metaphors of cognition, for example. From the beginning we are asked to
consider the similarity between humans and machines in the process of
computation. Turing consistently describes machine states in terms of "states
of mind," "awareness," and "memory." All of these descriptions capture some
part of Turing's idea. But it eludes them also, because it does not fit neatly
into a reductive history of a given discipline: neither computer science, nor
cognitive science, nor mathematics. In connecting Turing to Wittgenstein, we
will perceive it ultimately as an experimental, ludic even, enterprise. Like
Turing's imitation game, which came decades later, the Turing machine
constituted a simulation, capable of imitating all other symbolic systems,
from intelligence, to calculus, and literature.

Reconstructing the influence of Wittgenstein's thought on Turing confirms the
place of Turing's "On Computability" in the conversation about language, pain,
and cognition. Seen in the light of Wittgenstein's philosophy, Turing's work
and consequently the early history of computing acquires a broader
connotation, beyond the narrow confines of the *Entscheidungsproblem*, the
problem the paper addressed explicitly. In 1936, on the eve of World War II,
Turing imagined more than a formula: it was a thing that could explore the
limits of theory, and a theory that identified a new class of emerging things.
Through Turing's well-documented involvement in Government Code and Cypher
School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, actual Turing machines changed the nature of
war: used at first to break encrypted military communications and then to
compute missile trajectories. But as I will argue here, Turing machines also
changed humanity's relationship with symbolic thought. And unless we
understand Turing's legacy beyond war-making, we risk limiting its creative
potential to mechanisms of destruction.

[^ln1-anticipate]: As Alonzo Church mentioned in his review of the paper a
year later, Turing's mathematical insight was anticipated by concomitant work
in the field [@church_computable_1937].

[^ln1-platotr]: I translate the passage into literal, if awkward, English to
preserve some of the interesting characteristics of the original Greek. In
particular, note the parallelism between *exōthen* and *endothen*, the
ambiguity of *allotrion*, as something that comes from another, and the subtle
slide between *graphō* (letter, figure, writing) and *tupōn* (type,
impression, trace). I extend my gratitude to Stathis Gourgouris, Simos Zenios,
and Guy Smoot for their help with the Greek translations.

[^ln1-turingcog]: Turing's later work suggests that his use of cognitive
language throughout "On Computable Numbers" was not accidental, and that he
meant it to define sentience more generally [@turing_computing_1950].

The nexus between Alan Turing and Ludwig Wittgenstein in the years between
1931-1939 at King's College, Cambridge gives us a glimpse into the
intellectual context of the Turing machine. Wittgenstein broached the problem
of reading machines first in *The Blue and Brown Books* along with
*Philosophical Grammar* (all compiled in the early 1930s), then in his
lectures and remarks on the foundations of psychology and mathematics from the
late 1930s, and finally in *Philosophical Investigations*, (written between
1945 and 1949). To give you a sense of the timeline: Alan Turing's entered
King's College in 1931 [@hodges_alan_1983, 78] and his paper on computable
numbers appeared in print in 1936. It is likely that the two philosophers met
at the Moral Science Club, where by the 1930s Wittgenstein "monopolized the
discussion," even in the presence of prominent philosophers like George Edward
Moore [@duncan-jones_g._1958, 25]. Turing attended Wittgenstein's lectures on
the foundations of mathematics in 1939.

Andrew Hodges, the Oxford mathematician and Turing's biographer, attributes
Turing's engagement with the mechanical basis of mathematical proof to the
tutelage of Cambridge mathematicians Max Newman and G.H. Hardy. Hodges writes
that in the summer of 1935, Turing "dreamed of machines." The idea of bridging
mathematics to the physical world by a mechanical process "revolved in Alan's
mind" [@hodges_alan_1983]. That may have been. However, reading Turing in the
context of Wittgenstein's notes and lectures suggests a parallel, if not an
alternative intellectual lineage.

As we shall see, there is a remarkable consistency between the multitude of
Wittgenstein's "broken" reading machines and Turing's universal symbolic
manipulator. The parallel is even more striking when one considers Turing's
later work on the "imitation game" as a litmus test for artificial
intelligence, echoing Wittgenstein's interest in functional language games.
The mathematical formulae in Turing's papers should not obscure the writer's
preoccupation with hermeneutics more generally. For example, literature on
Turing's intelligence test usually ignores the long discursive passages
analyzing poetry in the original paper.

If we take Turing machines to stand in as a kind of a universal symbol for
computation itself, capable of transforming the practice of arts and letters
in almost every field of aesthetic and intellectual activity, it becomes
paramount to view them outside of the narrow confines of mathematical theory.
Understanding Turing machines within the history of symbolic interpretation
more broadly, brings computing closer to the light of cultural criticism. The
bulk of this chapter is therefore concerned with drawing the intertextual
connections between Turing's early work on computation and Wittgenstein's
"middle period," between his *Tractatus* and *Philosophical Investigations*.
The two thinkers occupy the same vibrant intellectual milieu in Cambridge for
the best part of the decade. Their work during this period shows a significant
thematic overlap, which although acknowledged, receives scant attention in the
critical literature.[^ln1-cope]

[^ln1-cope]: See for example @copeland_what_2000 and
@wagner_wittgenstein_2005.

Wittgenstein wrote that his *Blue and Brown Notebooks* comprise "some notes to
my pupils, so that they may have something to carry home with them, in their
hands if not their brains" [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, vii]. "The Blue Book"
begins with a question of interpretation: "What is a meaning of a word?" From
the start, Wittgenstein cautions his students against choosing the easy
answer, which holds that meaning resides in the head. Wittgenstein writes:

> It is misleading then to talk of thinking as of a "mental activity". We may
> say that thinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. This
> activity is performed by the hand, when we think by writing; by the mouth
> and larynx, when we think by speaking; and if we think by imaging signs or
> pictures, I can give you no agent that thinks. If then you say that in such
> cases the mind thinks, I would only draw your attention to the fact that you
> are using metaphor, that here the mind is the agent in a different sense
> from that in which the hand can be said to be the agent in writing.

The "locality of thought" poses a problem of analogy. Wittgenstein explains
that when we see a sentence on paper, the external manifestation of a thought,
we assume that some analogous structure exists somewhere in the brain.
Perhaps, Wittgenstein speculates, we could even observe the brain directly, in
the process of writing. Both phenomena, brain- and paper- bound, could
properly be called the *expression* of thought. Yet neither can offer the
definitive location where thinking happens. Rather, Wittgenstein suggests, we
are witnessing a metaphor: some set of correlations between two distinct
activities. And it may be that the correlations themselves are what we mean by
"thought." Neither brain nor paper make sense as *the* site of cognition by
itself, just like it would not make sense to interrupt a metaphor---"memory
the warder of the ~~brain~~ (from *Macbeth)---and then look for it in the
remaining snippet.

Our difficulty in locating the definitive site of thought points to the
inadequacy of Cartesian dualism between body and mind. Neither physical nor
mental descriptions of thought are sufficient to locate the site of cognition,
Wittgenstein argues. As an example of such a difficulty and likely having a
passage from Descartes in mind[^ln1-descartes] Wittgenstein asks, "Can a
machine think" [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16]? The problem, as he explains, is
not one of finding a machine that can do the job---of manipulating signs, for
example. It lies in the ability of a machine to enact the both sides of the
metaphoric equation. "Doing the job," the manipulation of signs, must
correspond to something else. Severed from some other analogical structure,
the "blind" manipulation of signs is a meaningless activity. Meaning,
Wittgenstein seems to suggest, resides simply in this analogy between
something (symbol) and something else (mechanism).

Wittgenstein extends his thought experiments about reading machines in his
*Brown Notebook.* Let us study the word "reading," he suggests early on. By
reading, he means the activity of "translating script into sounds," "of
writing according to dictation," or "of copying in writing a page of print"
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 119]. Reading once again is "mechanical" reading,
without a sense of "understanding" or interpretation. What happens when an
average child reads a newspaper, for example? "His eyes glide along the
printed words, he pronounces them aloud or to himself, but other words he
pronounces after having seen their first few letters only, other again he
reads out letter by letter." The child acts as a "reading machine" when he
pays no attention to what he reads, even when he speaks the words out loud.
Yet he reads "faultlessly like a reliable machine." Another child merely
pretends to read.  He guesses at the words, and on occasion repeats things "by
heart", without actually seeing them on the page [@wittgenstein_blue_1965,
121-22]. Should either of these count as reading?

Wittgenstein continues to complicate such edge cases, challenging his
audience's intuitions of what it means to read and to understand. He gives
also the example of a hallucinating patient, who "reads" what to us looks like
gibberish, and the case of man who fakes reading Cyrillic by memorizing the
lines phonetically. He talks of machines too, which produce random sounds that
occasionally, by accident, correspond to some existing texts. In each case, we
envision two mechanisms, Wittgenstein writes, one visible and external and one
hidden and internal. To read, the reader must do more than go through the
motions of reading. Instead, we privilege the inward-facing signs of
comprehension as the "real criterion for a person's reading or not reading."
The physical motions, of gliding one's eyes across the page and saying the
words out loud, must connect in some way with appropriate internal, mental
representations.

But in fact no such internal mechanisms can be known to us or communicated to
others properly [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120]. We can only intuit the
reader's private experience of reading, or whether such reading attains the
desired correspondence between inward state and outward sign. A reading pupil
must convince his teacher that the scanned sign had the intended effect. This
requires more words in a sort of an interrupted hermeneutic circle, the two
sides of which do not quite connect to complete the communication feedback
circuit.

Wittgenstein finally describes the mechanisms of reading as an "indirect way
of transmitting a feeling." "Something that we can never know happens at the
other end" of the communication act. Communication, as we would say today, is
always mediated.  In conclusion of the notebooks, Wittgenstein imagines the
possibility of unmediated, "direct" modes communication, capable of
transmitting feelings from one person to another [@wittgenstein_blue_1965,
185].

Thought experiments in *The Blue and Brown Notebooks* do not amount to a
cohesive model of communication, semiotics, or the mind. They do however
contain the seeds of the reading and writing machines later imagined by Alan
Turing and subsequently passed into the foundations of computer science.
Wittgenstein's experimental thought machines prefigure the modern computer.
Wittgenstein conjures these fantastical broken machines ultimately to address
the problem of symbolic interpretation.

[^ln1-descartes]: Descartes writes in his 1637 *Discourse on Method*: "If
there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or some
other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they
were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; whereas if there were
any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our
action as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very
certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true
men." Also quoted in @dennett_can_2004, 297.

*Philosophical Grammar,* written around the same time as the *Blue and Brown
Notebooks*, gives us another into the pre-history of the literary device. It
begins again with a problem of "understanding" and "not understanding." "To
understand language," Wittgenstein writes, means "to take in symbolism as a
whole" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 5]. From the very first passages,
Wittgenstein envisions "understanding" as a type of trans-mediation. In
comparing the understanding of language propositions to music, he writes: "for
explanation I can only translate the musical picture into a picture in another
medium and let one picture throw light on the other"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 5 & 41]. And elsewhere: "How curious: we
should like to explain the understanding of a gesture as a translation into
words, and the understanding of words as a translation into gestures"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 42]. Ultimately, he describes what we mean
by "understanding" as a "process of translation from one symbolism into
another; tracing a picture, copying something, or translating into another
mode of representation" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 45]. To understand
something something said is akin to modeling it in clay or drawing.

In light of our earlier discussion about metaphoric transference,
Wittgenstein's hermeneutics amount to the making of metaphors across media. To
understand, it is not enough to explain language in language. One must trade
symbolisms, creating a metaphor that explains one representational system in
terms of another. This process is not exact. How would one check if the "clay
model" corresponds to the "language model" properly? In thinking of the
various ways in which the process of translation breaks, Wittgenstein
continually returns to the pianola, a type of a player piano. In the player
piano, the relationship between music score sheet and the keyboard is rigidly
defined.  Perforated sheet music passes through the machine, activating a set
of corresponding pins. The conceptual world of the mechanism and the
conceptual world of music notation correspond exactly. The machine in effect
enacts the metaphor.

![Electrically-operated musical instrument by Clyde Coleman of Chicago, Il.
1914, US1107495A.](images/pianola.png)

In the early passages of *Philosophical Grammar*, Wittgenstein explains:
"Aren't our sentences parts of a mechanism? As in a pianola? But suppose it is
in bad condition?  So it is not the effect but the purpose of the signs (the
holes in the pianola roll). Their purpose *within* the mechanism"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 10]. Wittgenstein elaborates a few pages
later:

> The sentences that we utter have a particular purpose, they are to produce
certain effects. They are parts of a mechanism, perhaps a psychological
mechanism, and the words of the sentences are also parts of the mechanism
(levers, cogwheels, and so on). The example that seems to illustrate what
we're thinking of here is an automatic music player, a pianola. It contains a
roll, rollers, etc., on which the piece of music is written is some kind of
notation (the position of holes, pegs, and so on). It's as if the written sign
gave orders which are carried out by keys and hammers
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 69].

As was the case with reading automata in *The Blue and Brown Notebooks*,
Wittgenstein again substitute a physical mechanism for the process of symbolic
interpretation. On this view, words and music notation alike, have "a purpose"
to elicit some "effects" in the reader/player. But as before, we cannot always
expect the mechanism of interpretation to function properly, nor do we have a
reliable way to check its operation. "Suppose the pianola is in bad
condition," Wittgenstein repeats. The signs on the roll could produce "hisses
and bangs" instead of music, for example. One could object that notes are
always "meant" to play on a mechanism in perfect working order. But to explain
what is meant, we would need to draw yet another diagram. By analogy, the
"sense" of an "order" lies in its "effect on an obedient man"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 60-70]. The pianola exemplifies what will
come into a much starker contrast later in this chapter: that the mechanisms
of symbolic communication ultimately belong to a class of controlling devices.
Metaphors control in the sense of mediating state changes between two
disparate conceptual systems.

When drawing the analogy between mental and mechanical processes, Wittgenstein
explicitly rejects the model of language as a "psychophysical" mechanism.
Rather, as the title of the work suggests, Wittgenstein is in search for the
"grammar" governing the engagement: between speakers and listeners, readers
and writers, player pianos and musical scores. By the end of the work, grammar
emerges as a set of "conventions." Wittgenstein complicates the mechanism by
inserting an extra layer of "rules" that mediate between symbol and machine or
mental state. A convention could be included in a chart, for example. And it
is possible that "there is a part of the mechanism which resembles the chart,
and is inserted between the language-part of the mechanism and the rest of it"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 190]. "Imagine a language consisting of
commands," Wittgenstein writes in conclusion.  It is to direct a human
"forwards," "back," "right," and "left," "quickly" and "slowly"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 197] The grammar, like a table of
correspondences, explains the meaning of the signs. Today, we would call it a
"program." Programs translate arbitrary symbolic notation into physical
action.  In this way, we can move away from speaking of "intended effects" or
"proper obedience," and rather concentrate on the mediating layer that
describes the rules of engagement.

Turing met Wittgenstein's at King's College sometime in the 1930s. Although
there are no records of them meeting explicitly until Turing's attendance of
Wittgenstein's lectures on the foundation of mathematics in 1939
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 7], both men's work exhibits sustained
attention to computing machines narrowly and to the mechanical manipulation of
symbols more generally. From the notes on Wittgenstein's lectures complied and
published by Cora Diamond, it is clear that Turing was a vociferous presence
in the class. His name is mentioned eighty-six times in the text, more than
any other student by a wide margin.[^ln1-margin] At some point of the course
Wittgenstein concludes his lecture in saying: "Unfortunately, Turing will be
away from the next lecture, and therefore that lecture will have to be
somewhat parenthetical. For it is not good my getting the rest to agree to
something that Turing would not agree to" [@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976,
67-68].

Like the notebooks beforehand, Wittgenstein structures his lectures around the
problem of symbolic interpretation. "I am going to talk about the
interrelation of mathematical symbols," Wittgenstein begins. We imagine that
logical laws represent some sort of "fixed" mechanisms "behind" the symbols
used to express them. "I am speaking against the idea of logical machinery,"
Wittgenstein says in lecture XX. "The idea of logical machinery would suppose
that there was something behind our symbols"
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 194]. We imagine logic to be a sort of a
"rigid mechanism" that can only turn this way or the other. "Any rule can be
imagined to be a description of a mechanism---even the rule which says a pawn
must not be moved in a certain way," Wittgenstein writes
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 282]. The parts of the mechanism
subsequently exist in a causal relationship to one another.  Pushing this or
that lever will *always* result in such and such movement, because of the way
the mechanical parts are connected. We say that the mechanism is rigid or the
law is inexorable, when the results of an action are absolutely fixed.
Wittgenstein calls such a relationships "super-hardness." Where a judge can be
lenient, he explains, the law is compulsory. What we would now call "an
algorithm" compels predictable execution.

We are tempted, as before, to privilege the inner workings of the symbolic
mechanism, also at the core of meaning making in mathematics. "If I show you
the mechanism behind the [watch] dial, you will be able to predict the
movement of the hour hand for any given movement of the minute hand,"
Wittgenstein writes. "And you will not be sceptical." Yet even there, we would
be making an assumption about a mechanism that functions well. "For instance,
I may drop the clock" Wittgenstein explains, "so that the machinery is broken,
or a lighting may strike it [@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 195]. How are
we to know if the mechanism functions properly or not? For that we would need
"a picture" or some sort of schematics that describe what the proper mechanism
should look like. The mechanism is in fact itself a type of a symbol for the
perfected behavior of the sort that we expect. Where we tried to find the
mechanism behind the symbol, we found also the symbol behind the mechanism.
Once again we encounter the spiral of interpretation between intent and
effect, which never quite manage to explain each other.

In his lectures on mathematics, Wittgenstein never finds a way out of this
recursive conundrum. The foundations of mathematics rely on some such mutually
dependent relationship between the physical and the symbolic worlds. Whether
it is in math or in ordinary language, some magic happens at the coupling of
the matter and sign. The precise point of contact concerns Wittgenstein in all
fields of human activity, from literature to psychology and mathematics.

In all of these fields, Wittgenstein finds an implicit analogy between
"symbol" and "mechanism." A type of metaphor, the analogy itself is atomic. It
cannot be split further into something like "sign" and "referent" or the
"signifier" and the "signified." Considered apart, the two parts of the
metaphor are strictly meaningless. In his lectures on aesthetics, Wittgenstein
describes such a semiotic relationship as the "concomitance between mechanism
and its trace" [@wittgenstein_lectures_1966, 16]. In giving an account of
one's aesthetic judgment, the best we can do is to "trace a mechanism"
[@wittgenstein_lectures_1966, 13].

It would be a mistake to reduce Wittgenstein's semiotics to the mechanical
theory of the mind. Rather, in presenting his students and readers with a
number of hypothetical machines, Wittgenstein attempts to discover the rule
book of what he later calls the language game---or at lest to suggest that
such a rulebook might exist. Much has been written on this aspect of
Wittgenstein's thought and its relation to Bertrand Russel's symbolic logic.
In the context of our conversation, Wittgenstein's "middle period" is
important for its direct influence on Turing's model of computation.

Several prominent characteristics pass from Wittgenstein's reading machines to
Turing's universals. First, the symbolic machine emerges from the
metaphor-like correspondence between internal machine state and external
symbolic representation. Second, Wittgenstein discusses symbolic
representation in terms of its delayed effects, that is, ultimately, a type of
a remote control mechanism. And finally, Wittgenstein imagines a mediating
layer that holds the rules for translation between state and symbol. All of
these features, along with a penchant for ambiguous thought experimentation,
pass directly from Wittgenstein to Turing. Turing consequently attempts to
clean up after his teacher's profusion of broken interpretation machines.
Instead, he gives us one thought experiment, encompassing all possible center
and edge cases. In addition, Turing describes the minimal physical
requirements needed to actually build such a contraption. Turing imagines the
universal metaphor machine, given the right requirements, able to convert any
symbolic input into the corresponding physical state of the mechanism. It is a
machine that "traces the mechanism" of all other metaphoric mechanisms.

[^ln1-margin]: The prominence of Turing's voice in the lecture notes could be
attributed to his later prominence.

### 2.3 Instrument

Literature in computer science tends to see universal Turing machines as
algorithms: in other words, as virtual, second-order symbolic representations.
Yet it is impossible to entirely disassociate the implementation from the idea.
In his review of Turing's "On Computable Numbers" paper, Alonzo Church, the
American mathematician whose work anticipated Turing's (independently) in
several important aspects, later wrote that "a human calculator, provided with
pencil and paper and explicit instructions can be regarded as a kind of a
Turing machine" [@church_computable_1937, 42-3; also cited in
@petzold_annotated_2008, 63]. Disregarding the broader, metaphysical
implications of that statement, note for now the persistence of two essential
implements required for the minimally viable operation of the Church--Turing
human and machine calculators. Pen and paper assert themselves through the
abstraction.[^ln1-abstraction]

What are we to make of universal Turing machines implemented in virtual worlds
like *Wireworld* (a cellular automaton simulation), or *Minecraft* (a procedurally
generated sand-box world-exploration game)?

![Universal Turing machine as an idea. "Nick Gardner's *Wireworld* multiplier,
via a Turing machine."](images/turing-idea.png)

At the very least, we must admit that such simulations cannot rest on the
proverbial "turtles all the way down," unless that is, one believes that the
universe itself is a type of a Turing machine [@deutsch_quantum_1985;
@lloyd_ultimate_2000; @piccinini_computational_2007]. At some point, the
virtual world simulation meets the limitations of the physical world. Until
physicists agree on the ultimate nature of the universe as computation (or
not), we continue to assume that Turing simulations comprise second-order
ideational constructs, floating on top of first-order physical mechanisms. In
the case of *Wireworld* and *Minecraft* the simulation "runs" on personal
computers. The physical capabilities of the bottom-most device limit the
computation power of all *n+1* order Turing simulations. Consequently, the
simulated UTM cannot outperform (in terms of cycles per second, instructions
per cycle, or its capacity to hold a number of instructions) the machine
executing the simulation. The bottom-most turtle may have its head in the
clouds, but its feet rest firmly on the ground.

The exact plane where the symbolic meets the literal is difficult to identify
definitively. At some imperceptible point software disappears into hardware.
Such ambiguity between hardware and software leads to some controversy in the
critical literature, as evidenced by Lev Manovich's playful response to
Kittler's "there is no software" argument. If I understand it correctly,
Kittler's short but often cited essay picks up the thread of Kittler's earlier
work to posit what he calls a "postmodern writing scene." "We do not write
anymore," writes Kittler: "human-made writing passes through microscopically
written inscriptions which, in contrast to all historical writing tools, are
able to read and write by themselves" [@kittler_there_1995]. According to this
schema, Kittler sees the paper-bound design blueprints of the first integrated
microprocessor as the last "real" piece of writing. Everything written after
that point is hardware (because software is hardware at that "microscopic"
level).

Manovich inverts Kittler's argument into "there is only software," by which he
means that in a pragmatic sense, the affordances of a given medium are
determined by software. A printed page begins to differ from its computed
analogy only when readers are able to effect something on the screen that they
could not on paper. To this end, Manovich encourages his readers to become
active developers of software, rather than its passive consumers
[@manovich_there_2011, 274]. In that, Manovich reasserts the possibility of
writing in the silicon age. Kittler (who passed in 2011) could perhaps object
to that line of reasoning in maintaining that chip architecture (the last
written work, according to him) still determines, as foundation, all higher
levels of textuality "floating" above the silicon bedrock. And no amount of
learning to code would give an ordinary subject the resources required to write
in silicon---a process so advanced and expensive as to be limited to a handful
of international chip manufacturers. In opening a series of nested black boxes,
the post-silicon writer hits the impenetrable casket of chip architecture. Few
of today's engineer-writers are able to work on such deeply-embedded hardware
level.

Before we ourselves get lost in the liminal space between matter and idea, let
us recover a measure of oddity found in the now ubiquitous operation of Turing
machines. Remember that Turing's original description of the Turing machine
derived from a legacy of thought experimentation. Turing does not begin to
build actual machines until his move to Princeton in 1936. A universal Turing
machine comes to life initially as an idea that can take on the structure of
other ideas expressed symbolically. And though Turing describes his machine in
the language of mathematics (where his most significant contribution lies), his
description also contains the bare minimum of a mechanical device. No matter
how symbolic a Turing machine aspires to be, no matter how ascendant to the
realm of the ideal, it remains rooted in the mechanics of reading, writing, and
interpretation.

So far, we too have confronted the literary device only as an idea: imagined
first in the methodological contexts of formalist literary analysis and then as
a thought experiment about generalized symbolic manipulation. But from a
strictly materialist point of view, ideas cannot exist without some physical
underpinnings. Forced to encounter the universal Turing machine *as a
mechanism*, the media historian will find that it borrows from a number of
extant designs, which, together and incrementally, give the UTM its physical
form.

A media history of the Turing machine as device differs from its intellectual
history as symbolic, mathematical abstraction in interesting and instructive
ways.[^ln1-turing] Bracketing for the moment the mathematical and cognitive
implications of Turing's work, I want to approach the Turing machine from the
perspective of a book historian and a media scholar. If the Turing machine is
to be taken at face value, not as an algorithm, but as an instrument, what kind
of a machine would it be? What are its antecedents?

Most of the minimal physical requirements to build a universal Turing machine
were within reach in the 1930s, at the time Turing authored his influential
paper. In practice, his proposal would require first, an apparatus capable of
"scanning" and "erasing" a "finite number of symbols." Second, we would need
what Turing calls "one-dimensional paper," divided into discrete squares "like
a child's arithmetic book" [@turing_computable_1937, 249].[^ln1-infinite]
Furthermore, we would need some sort of a mechanism to advance tape through the
machine, or, alternatively, to propel the scanning mechanism along the length
of the tape. Having assembled these elements, our creation would look roughly
like a cross between a telegraph, a film projector, and a
typewriter.[^ln1-davey]

Were we to patent the Turing machine in the United States, at the time of its
conception (1936-37), the above elements would find prior art in mechanisms
such as the "Numeral adding or subtracting attachment for type-writing
machines" [@daugherty_numeral_1894], "Combined Type-writing and Computing
Machine" [@degener_combined_1911], "Computing Attachment for Typewriters"
[@wright_computing_1914], "Computing Mechanism" [@wright_computing_1915], and
"Combined Type-writing and Adding Machine" [@ellis_combined_1914] among others.
All of these machines contain some combination of a reading and writing "head,"
storage tape, and movement mechanism.

By the end of the nineteenth century a number of lesser contraptions anticipate
the functional elements of Turing's machine. And by 1936, when Turing publishes
his paper on computable numbers, these inventions not only anticipate the
modern computer, but are brought to mass market in the widespread manufacture
of computing scales, dial recorders, electric tabulating machines, and
computing typewriters made by companies like Underwood Computing Machine,
Electromatic, and International Business Machines (IBM). Rather than a single
eureka moment, the invention of the universal machine should therefore be
viewed as a gradual historical process that culminates in Turing's universal
(and minimally viable) specifications.

A number of inventions at the end of the nineteenth century pertain
specifically to "circuit-controlling devices controlled by a traveling
perforated strip or tape" [@cuttriss_telegraphy_1893]. Prior to perforated
tape, the transmission of messages by telegraph required the presence of a
skilled operator, able to transcribe messages from text to Morse code, and into
the physical motion of a lever-operated circuit. In the operation of early
telegraphy, the human operator acted as a mute interpreter between text and
telegraph. The transcription of text into signal, and back onto paper, required
the real-time presence of human encoders and decoders.

The perforated tape decoupled the human from the machine. In US1187035 (1916)
on "Telegraphy", Albert and Ralph Bumstead explain: "the object of our
invention is to provide a system of telegraphy which does not require skilled
operators for the transmission and reception of messages"
[@bumstead_telegraphy_1916]. Instead, the message was transcribed into
perforation via mechanical means and then fed into the mechanism. The tape
mechanics of the typewriter could then be coupled with the electrics of the
telegraph, with perforated tape acting as a mediator between the two "worlds"
of mechanics and electricity.

A number of contraptions emerged at the time with the aim of transfiguring the
mechanical action of the typewriter into perforation, and, consequently,
perforation into script, completing the circuit between automated "encoding"
and "decoding." As one machine converted human input into mechanical states,
and into signal, another machine converted signals into mechanical states and
thereon into human-legible messages.

A multitude of inventions capitalized on the control capabilities of removable
storage media by the beginning of the of the twentieth century. These included
machines for tape-controlled telegraphic transmission
[@wheatstone_improvement_1874; @murray_tape-controlled_1905;
@bumstead_telegraphy_1916], tape-controlled printing [@creed_printing_1911],
printing telegraphs [@hallden_printing-telegraph_1929], and remote broadcast
programming devices for radio and television content [@vriendt_program_1934;
@brown_automatic_1936; @brown_selective_1936]. With the invention of punch
cards and perforated tape (also used in textile looms, as early as 1725), a
message meant for another human became also a physical medium---bumps and
holes---used to animate the mechanical movement of the transmission apparatus.

For example, of the 33 asserted claims in the Bumstead brothers' "Telegraphy"
patent, the first 13 relate to the "transmission of intelligence,"

> [...] adapted to initiate a succession of electrical impulses all of which
> have a character representing significance, a receiver adapted to detect
> variations in time intervals elapsing between successive impulses, a
> plurality of interpreting relays selectively actuated by said receiver, and a
> printed mechanism responsive for the combined action
> [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12-13].

What begins as a description of a mechanism for information transmittal, ends
with a claim about hermeneutics of control. Starting with clause 14, the
brothers begin to describe "a telegraph system" capable of "transmitting
impulses" at varying time intervals. In the language of the patent, the length
of the time interval "represents significance," involving an automated receiver
responsible for "distributing, interpreting, and recording." The printing
mechanism is further "arranged to print the interpretation of the signals which
is made by the interpreting relays" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 6]. The
interpreting relays transform time intervals into a "typographical form"
representing "a letter, a figure, or other characters," "in accordance with a
code" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 13]. Initially, the telegraph prints to
"transmit intelligence." But the authors also understand that the varying time
intervals could also signify other information, meant to actuate a variety of
devices.

By the middle of the patent, the brothers describe their telegraph as a general
"controlling medium," which can power everything from typesetting machines to
more general "sunflower switches." "Indeed the detector and the interpreting
relay could be made to actuate a set of sunflower switches for an indicator
without including a printer at all," the authors conclude
[@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12].

Along with hundreds of similar inventions patented around the turn of the
twentieth century, Bumstead brothers describe a mechanism that could function
as a Turing machine with little modification. The automated telegraph, driven
by ticker tape, and connected to a printer contain all the necessary
requirements set out by Turing: a discrete symbolic language, the removable
storage medium, and a device that can alter its internal states based on the
reading and writing of scanned symbols. They are able "read" and "write" and
otherwise manipulate symbolic representation, they ingest tape, and they
convert covert symbol into internal structure. Like the Turing machine, the
Bumstead telegraph is capable of recursion: ultimately, it can produce and
interpret its own control codes. By 1905, Donald Murray, the inventor of the
popular Murray telegraph, could write that "if we disregard the small class of
telegrams that merely express emotions, *the essence of telegraphy is control*
[emphasis mine]." He wrote also that "telegraph systems, therefore, belong not
to the class of producing or distributing, but to the class of controlling
mechanisms" [@murray_setting_1905, 556]. For the automated telegraph, control
code and the message are one. The mechanism interprets some signals as figure
and character and other signals as control code affecting the internal
mechanical configuration of the device. The first type of code holds
"significance" for humans, where the second for the mechanism itself. It is
"transmitting intelligence" in a sense of externalizing machine states and
"interpreting" in the sense of mechanical reconfiguration of internal parts.

When viewed in the context of book history, the universal Turing machine
signifies a consummation of several broad, long-term trends that begin with the
invention of writing itself.  The material history of literary
computing begins with petrified words that endure forever, and ends with word
as an electrical charge: animated, radiant, fluid, and iridescent
[@mcgann_radiant_2001; @bryant_fluid_2002].

To rediscover the book in the guise of a computational literary artifact means
coming to terms with it as a robot---a device for remote machine control. It
entails seeing through to the simulated nature of the electronic text.
Everything that we know to be true of text in print---from the shape of the
letters to the position of text on a page, to characters, words, sentences,
paragraphs, sections, chapters, and manuscripts, to more abstract categories
like poems, novels, plays, and short stories, to authors, styles, narratives,
and discourses, in short to all textual constructs that have their dimensions
in physical space (and that is all of them), the entire burden of literary
theory---must be reconstructed again as a *simulation*.

Furthermore, it means also gaining awareness of other simulations that are
enacted simultaneously through the device. Where a book is a just a book, the
simulated book fulfills other functions. As a universal Turing machine, the
device has the potential to conjure multiple metaphors. The universal machine
is a machine for making all possible metaphors. It can simulate a book, a
telephone, an alarm clock, a calculator, a typewriter, a censor, a surveyor, a
surveillance system, and otherwise an instrument of governance. Its potential
to simulate other machines is unbounded.

Finally, the very metaphysical nature of Turing machines implies the
irreversible admixture of matter, content, and control. When reading a paper
and cloth book, one can definitively isolate a) the physical properties of
paper and cloth from b) the content of the book and from c) the legal and
political elements governing the production of textuality. To wit: tear out the
copyright notice along with the ISBN number, copy the words into a notebook,
and recycle the paper. The literary device, by contrast, ingests both symbolic
representation and control code through the same input stream. Where images of
governance (like trademark and copyright symbols) *signify*, computed text
*embodies*. Computation enacts control in exactly the sense by which
Wittgenstein suggests to insert a layer of "rules" between symbol and
interpretation, the sense by which Turing imagines computation as symbolic
embodiment, and in the sense carried out through a class of devices for remote
control and communication.

If symbols, something used to represent something else, elicit a type of an
illusion, the universal symbolic machine enacts the ultimate illusion. It
creates a phantasmal image of symbolism itself. The history of computing is
thus a history of symbolism in the broadest possible meaning of the word, which
includes lyric poetry and symbolic logic. The difficult truth for the
contemporary reader is that the computational metaphor, embodied on the level
of the device, resists interpretation by conventional means. Metaphors of
computation frame deep structure affecting basic everyday interaction with
computers. As with all metaphors, nothing is what it seems: to "save" a
document, to "copy" it and to "delete" it, to "surf" or to "browse" the
internet, to "run" a program, the softness of software and the hardness of
hardware, to "turn the page," to "bookmark," to "highlight," and ultimately to
"read a book"---these are all metaphors that obscure the underlying material
conditions of symbolic exchange. The metaphors ingratiate themselves to us in
daily use. With time they disappear from view: invisible metaphors of
invisibility.  When habituated, they alienate us from the symbol. A new wave of
estrangement is needed to rouse it from its metaphorical slumber.

In drawing the history of the book as a universal Turing machine, we observe
the evolution of symbolism into its final and totalizing form. By converting
machine states into symbols, the Turing machine represents the ultimate
negation of matter. It subsumes all lesser mechanisms amenable to
computation---which some would say includes brains and universes.[^ln1-brains]
The universal Turing machine has the potential to mediate everywhere, yet,
paradoxically, it's method of "mediation" abstracts from any notion of medium
or intervening substance.

Under the command and control regime of the Turing machine, text loses its
adhesion to the world. Yet it would be a mistake to think of it as wholly
ethereal. The symbol itself, in its rawest form, anchors the Turing machine to
the confines of the physical universe. No matter the transcendental impulse,
the universal Turing machine cannot be abstracted beyond its minimal physical
requirements: "tape," "symbol," "scanned square," "in the machine"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231].[^ln1-inside]

A figure of computation emerges in the dual movement between symbol and
machine: the machine that pushes the symbol towards the ethereal, and the
symbol that pulls the machine back towards earth. This dynamic encapsulates the
bargain at the center of computational media, explored for the duration of the
book. The machine frees symbolic representation from its material confines. The
price of freedom is the very opacity of the material context. Where words etched
in paper or stone constituted a single site for textual activity, the digital
word exists in a simulated environment physically apart from the underlying
material substratum. Freedom reveals itself as a simulation.

The seeming immateriality of digital media entails real-world effects: the
costs of replication plummet, for example. Computational text can be copied
effortlessly, with minimal cost, and with near-perfect fidelity.
Hyper-reproducibility of the sort was unthinkable for most of the twentieth
century. The machine allows for rapid remediation. Lowered costs of copying
further reduce barriers to access and conveyance. Symbols that adhere lightly
to their medium are easy to store and to transport. Witness the rise of
massive, global public knowledge projects like online search engines and
encyclopedias as a direct consequence. Such projects unfold the logic of
immateriality, which moves towards totalizing archives and universal
accessibility.[^ln1-google] When representation appears to weigh nothing, one
imagines a weightless totality of all representation, available immediately and
everywhere. The perceived weightlessness of text has other side-effects as
well. For example, a text that adheres lightly to its medium is also difficult
to contain, making onerous the governance of symbolic representation and
weakening traditional controls like censorship and intellectual property
rights.

Yet, despite the appearances, the sign does not and cannot exist in a vacuum.
Rather, the symbol splits in two: with one half arising visibly, a weightless
and apparent screen simulation, and the other half, opaque, etched into the
hefty and hidden material contingencies of the device. The material substrates
of computational text likewise carry real-world affordances and consequences.
They are first and foremost hidden from view. Drives and tapes reside inside of
black or aluminum boxes. If only because they carry electrical current and have
the potential to catch fire, they are regulated. They contain heavy and rare
metals, often hazardous if touched or ingested. The computational part of the
sign is sealed in miniaturized containers that prevent access and to resist
tempering. These are but some of the realities of computed text. It is text
intertwined with machine internals and control code and it is often
hermeneutically sealed to resist human interpretation.

In the process of textual production, printing and typesetting, it is certain
that my words were mixed with machine language, which in turn changed the
structure of the devices in your lap, in your hand, near to your eye,
embedded, or embodied. I could say that I bear no responsibility for extending
the reach of machine language so close to the reader. But that would be
factually incorrect. The choice of my writing implements and my channels of
communication affect deeply the contexts of interpretation. Such choices, in
aggregate, define the shared ecosystem of knowledge that surrounds us.
Traditional strategies of close reading which limit interpretation to the
parsing of visible content risk missing the concealed machinations of naked
circuit control. It looks like you are reading a book, but this book may
change depending on the readers race, gender, ethnicity, geography, or
political affiliation. Who has agency program the device? Were a book also a
pill or fused with the neural circuitry of the brain, would you know what and
whom you were reading?

[^ln1-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
