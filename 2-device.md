## Chapter 2: Laying Bare the Device (The Modernist Roots of Computation)

"The weakest point in our present day universe is the incapacity of man to
meet the machine, the culture conserve, or the robot, other than through
submission, actual destruction, and social revolution" [@moreno_who_1953,
233]. So wrote the Austrian-American psychiatrist, Jacob L. Moreno between the
years of 1934 and 1953, in his idiosyncratic, sprawling, and now seldom read
volume, *Who Shall Survive?* He is remembered today as a pioneer of group
therapy and an early critic of Freud and socialism. Sociologists have also
recently rediscovered his work as precursor to network analysis. His books
contain beautiful diagrams, sprouting nodes and edges, with titles like
"Structure of a Cottage Family," "A Handicraft Group," and "The Civilian
Social Atom." Moreno was also a humanist and a philosopher of technology and
culture. In opposition to eugenics, popular at the time, his answer to "Who
Shall Survive?" was "everyone" [@moreno_who_1953, 245].

Humanity, according to Moreno, faces two major threats: first embodied in the
aggression from other human beings, and second, in the aggression of robots
or, what Moreno alternatively calls the "cultural conserve" and the
"zootechnical animal" [@moreno_who_1953, 237]. Robots for Moreno encompass all
devices, social structures, and products of the mind that diminish creativity.
With time, "technical devices" and the "methods in the making of cultural
products" are inherited and "used with less friction." For Moreno, technology
is first and foremost a labor-saving device, creativity being the single most
important kind of labor. When the effort of creativity is diminished
significantly, humans begin to "neglect and abandon the genuine and
outstanding creative process." The robot leads to the extinguishing of "all
the active, living moments," striving towards the "illusion of the finished,
perfected product" [@moreno_who_1953, 233]. This illusion reduces humans to
"machine-addicts," residing in a "jungle of robots" that threatens to
suffocate all spontaneous activity. Through robots, life then becomes a
script.

In the name of comfort, safety, and prolonged life, technocracy disempowers
the very subjects whose lives it claims to preserve. The zootechnical animal
exchanges the human capacity for self-determination for the promised certainty
of a better future. Moreno writes:

> The eugenic dreamer and the technological dreamer have one idea in common to
substitute and hasten the slow process of nature. Once the creative process is
encapsulated in a book it is *given*; it can be recapitulated eternally by
everybody without the effort of creating anew.  Once a machine for a certain
pattern of performance is invented a certain produce can be turned out in
infinite numbers practically without effort [...] Once that miraculous eugenic
formula will be found a human society will be given prefect and smooth at
birth, like a book off a press [@moreno_who_1953, 236].

Like king Thamus from Plato's *Phaedrus*, Moreno distrusts rote mechanization
of thought itself. All forms of displaced agency fall under suspicion: the
plow, the pen, the book, the typewriter, the gun, the rocket, and the atomic
bomb, radio and television, central planning, corporate governance, and legal
codex [@moreno_who_1953, 237-44]. Contrary to my intuitions, this list places
both books and bombs at the same level of analysis. For Moreno, both
instruments are similar in that they embody a detached form of agency. They
both seem to act on their own accord. With time, volition so detached and
mechanized begins to govern without consensus or comprehension. Splintered
from its source, the robot staggers forth, *golem*-like, through books, laws,
and social institutions. Near immortal, images of the past proliferate and
crowd out the present. Moreno writes:

> Once off the press, the parent, the producer, the author is immaterial; the
> book goes to all places and to all people, it does not care where it is read
> and by whom. Many robots have further in common the attribute of comparative
> immortality. A book, a film, an atomic bomb, they do not perish in the human
> sense, the same capacity is always there, they can be reproduced *ad
> infinitum* [...] Our human world is increasingly filled with robots and
> there seems to be no end to new forms and new developments
> [@moreno_who_1953, 239].

In the aftermath of World War II, Moreno expanded the first edition of his
book to consider the ultimate automaton, the atomic bomb. "Mankind has been
awakened from a dream," he writes. The atomic bomb gives humanity a glimpse of
its common enemy. A mindless agent in possession of detached human volition,
it competes with living actors for survival. Once in motion, robots---books
and bombs---continue to do their bidding blindly. They survive and continue to
shape the social and the mental worlds to come. Moreno explains:

> Many of the domesticated robots are blessed with the attribute of becoming
> labor-saving devices, which has, however the unpleasant consequence that
> they at times reduce the need for creating, promoting with leisure also
> inertia.  [...] Many of the robots have also the attribute in common of
> being able to affect human beings or other "targets at a distance," a book,
> a radio or a television sender can entertain or teach at a distance, like a
> gun, a rocket and an atomic bomb can kill people and destroy at a distance.
> The book is a robot par excellence [@moreno_who_1953, 238].

For Moreno, the inertia of past decisions embodied in extant mechanisms
ultimately poses a threat for human survival. In this view, the real
competition for survival happens not between persons, sects, races, or
nations, but between humanity and its automatons. To compete with the robot
humans must expand their capacity for creation. Creative spontaneity is the
one advantage they have over the zootechnical animal. The robot responds with
repetition, leading to indolence. It eases the burden of creativity, weakening
the capacity for poiesis. Moreno's therapy practice was therefore based on the
principle of creative spontaneity training, or "psychodrama," aimed at the
construction of communities that acknowledge and preserve a sense of personal
agency. As far as I can tell from the records, the practice involved group
improvisation and role-play, in what Moreno called the "techniques of freedom"
[@moreno_who_1953, 8].

Moreno's jarring parallelism between books and bombs reminds the reader that
both constitute a species of displaced agency, a problem long in the
background of Western liberal thought.[^ln1-consensus] In a strange way, both
print and weaponry represent agency delayed in time and space. The projectile
acts at a distance; once launched, it will complete its grim mandate even if
the command to act is withdrawn. Technology of the word similarly decouples
readers from writers. The book persists to mean in the absence of the author.
Once decoupled, seemingly autonomous agents---books, folders,
documents---clutter the social sphere, continuing to structure human
experience in the absence of the originating accord. Knowledge, in Plato's
terms begins to be replaced with the simulation or imitation [ὁμοίωμαi] of
knowledge [@plato_plato:_1999, 250a-b]. The above might appear a curious way
of putting things, but not unusual in the larger context of post-Kantian
humanism at the turn of the twentieth century. In Moreno's words we hear more
than an echo of Marx's critique of the fetishism of commodities, a dynamic by
which "definite social relation between men" assumes "the fantastic form of a
relation between things" [@marx_capital_1967, 72]. Moreno arrives at a similar
conclusion by another logic. In creating some of the earliest examples of
social network graphs, he finds (and objects to) the presence of things in the
position of social actors.

Moreno helps us see the book in a new light. If it was always, as he
suggested, a robot for enacting action at a distance, it is all the more
robotic as a device that draws electricity, an electronic book. When in the
1930s one could view Moreno's rhetoric about books and bombs as a
fanciful---technophobic even---view of literary technology, a century later
his concern appears pressing and prescient. The unintended consequences of
automated and disembodied agency, from artificially intelligent personal
assistants to market trading algorithms, worry scientists, legislators, and
philosophers. What looks like a book today indeed takes on the functions of a
gun and a trigger. Electronic books distributed on mobile phones, tablets, and
personal computers comprise a part of the same digital infrastructure that
powers drones and aircraft carriers. Today, computers in the service of the
world's largest purveyors of literature are also used by air traffic control
and covert intelligence agencies [@soyata_combat:_2012;
@logicworks_government_2015]. A cellular phone, once a device used solely for
voice telecommunication, is now used ubiquitously both to read books and to
detonate explosives at a distance.

These conditions compel us---historians, philologists, et al.---to reconsider
the cozy relationship we have had with books since the advent of the Gutenberg
press. Simulated text no longer plays by the same rules as print. The
bibliographic illusion veils machine internals. My task in this chapter will
be to illuminate the blueprint of computation within the electronic book. In a
reciprocal movement, I aim also to place the modern computer itself within the
long history of the book, as a piece of literary (and not just mathematical)
technology. To achieve these tasks, I will construct a short prehistory of the
literary device, based on materials roughly from the first half of the
twentieth century. I am interested in the simultaneous emergence of the
literary device as formal technique, a series of thought experiments, and
finally an instrument that lies at the modernist origins of contemporary
computational culture.

### 2.1 Technique

What kind of a *thing* is a literary *device*? The formal concept of a device,
used widely in literary studies, is in part an artifact of an unfortunate
translation from the Russian *priem*. The word would be better translated as
"technique," in the sense of "method," "approach," or "procedure." Device
contains these meanings as well, but in modern usage, it often carries a more
concrete connotation, as "an object, machine, or piece of equipment that has
been made for a special purpose" [@_device_2016]. "Laying bare the device,"
for Viktor Shklovsky, the Russian formalist critic who coined the phrase at
the turn of the century, meant making explicit the implied mechanisms of
literary trope, particularly in cases where such tropes turn "stale,"
"automatic," and "naturalized," that is, bereft of their original poetic and
evocative power [@shklovsky_voskreshenie_1914; @shklovksy_poetika_1919;
@shklovksy_art_2012].[^ln2-shklov]

Vladimir Nabokov, a writer conspicuously aware of his literary--theoretical
heritage, used the formal technique of "laying bare the device" often and with
relentless clinical precision. In the short story "A Guide to Berlin," to
which D. Barton Johnson attributes our first glimpse at Nabokov's "mature
virtuoso style," Nabokov writes:

> In front of the house where I live, a gigantic black pipe lies along the
outer edge of the sidewalk. A couple of feet away, in the same file, lies
another, then a third and a fourth---the street's iron entrails, still idle,
not yet lowered into the ground, deep under the asphalt. For the first few
days after they were unloaded, with a hollow clanging, from trucks, little
boys would run on them, up and down, and crawl on all fours through those
round tunnels, but a week later nobody was playing anymore and thick snow was
falling instead; and now when, cautiously probing the treacherous glaze of the
sidewalk with my thick rubber-heeled stick, I go out in the flat gray light of
the morning, an even stripe of fresh snow stretches along the upper side of
each black pipe [...] Today someone wrote "Otto" with his finger on the strip
of virgin snow, and I thought how beautifully that name, with its two soft o's
flanking the pair of gentle consonants suited the silent layer of snow upon
that pipe with its two orifices and its tacit tunnel [@nabokov_guide_1976, 27;
@johnson_guide_1979, 354].

This tightly wound vignette takes the formalist programmatic concern with
"laying bare the device" to its logical conclusion. The pipes can be read as a
metaphor for a literary device. Usually found beneath the street, they now sit
idle and visible above the surface. Yet even when exposed, the device fails to
captivate for long. Disused, it once again passes out of sight, covered in
snow. Concerned with surfaces, the narrator "probes the glaze" of the street
and finds a palindrome written in snow. The inscription "OTTO" not only
resembles the pipes visually, but is in itself a surface-revealing inscription
that makes the pipes visible again. Although the metaphoric pipe does not
reach beyond the page, the mimetic surface inscription draws attention to the
word's visual shape and acoustics. It invites readers to perform the symmetry
of its assonance and consonance as they pronounce the word. The round vowels
and the interrupting obstruents of "OTTO" contort the body in accordance with
the sound image: reverse mimesis, the body as sound pipe. The moment of
corporeal reenactment transcends the representational and paper-bound confines
of the medium. The performance makes the "making of the literary technique
obvious," obvious. Nabokov exposes the metaphor implicit in the very idea of
"laying bare the device." In this, lies the prevalent characteristic of
Nabokov's mature work, which often seeks to transcend the diegetic, fictional
world through sheer recursion of literary technique, where each successive
turn of abstraction brings the buried symbol closer to the reader.

Despite such emphasis on laying bare the device, formalist poetics (both in
art and in scholarship) fell short of producing an explicit theory of
technique. In this section, I will attempt to reconstruct the notion of
technique through the thought of four major literary theorists of the interwar
period: Viktor Shklovsky, Percy Lubbock, Walter Benjamin, and Mikhail Bakhtin.
This grouping does not amount to a school of thought as such. Rather, the
concept of technique emerges in parallel traditions at a formative time in the
history of the literary technology. Viewed in the context of technological
development, the emergence of technique as a critical category reflects the
broader concerns of the machine age. The very idea of *technology* does not
fully find its place in critical literature until the 1950-1970s, judging by
the rash of titles like like Martin Heidegger's *Die Frage nach der Technik*
(1954), Jacques Ellul's *La technique ou l'enjeu du siècle* (1954),  Lynn
White's *Medieval Technology and Social Change* (1966), and *The Technological
Man* (1969) by Viktor Firkiss, among many similar volumes appearing in the
period. Calling for the institution of a new field, the editors of the 1959
inaugural issue of the journal *Technology and Culture* would write about the
"neglect of study of technology" amidst a body of extant work that has
scarcely amounted to a systematic scholarly discipline [@kranzberg_at_1959].
"*Technology* is a word whose time has come," Langdon Winner would write in
his influential volume on *Autonomous Technology* in 1978
[@winner_autonomous_1978, 4]. Before technology, there was technique.

![Relative occurrence of the words "technology," "technique," and "machine" in

Seen in this light, the pre-WWII concern with literary technique anticipates
the post-war turn towards technology as a field of cultural analysis. The
formalist period in literary theory signalled a turn away from history and
philosophy of literature towards the mechanics of literary production. The
technical turn entailed a mechanistic understanding of language and
literature, by which linguistic phenomena began to be viewed as a system of
moving parts, capable of producing meaning through use. The turn to technique
meant also that the mechanisms of meaning production, on the sides of both
authorship and apprehension, were made accessible to a mass audience. The
Russian formalists in particular understood their task as one of radical
democratization of the literary sphere. High literature that was once the
purview of the select few could now belong to the proletariat at large. This
meant that the reading and the writing of literature had to be distilled into
a set of reproducible rules---technique over art---to be learned and shared
widely.

Aside from its political context, the mechanization of language is best viewed
in its instrumental environment. As we shall see in the later sections of this
chapter, developments in aesthetic theory I describe in here followed a period
of rapid innovation in the technologies of the word. The rise of formalist and
consequently structuralist thought---philosophy's linguistic turn that saw
language as a as system of rule-based games---parallel the rise of
programmable media, punch cards, and ticker tape. That is not to say that
technology and theory stand in a reductive causal relationship to one another.
They form rather a feedback loop, in which instruments, practices, and
explanatory models evolve through mutual reciprocation. My understanding of
the literary device in both of its senses---as technique and mechanism---is
therefore motivated by more than mere linguistic ambiguity in the meaning of
the word. Locating the literary theoretical construct of the device within its
technological context allows us to witness the contemporaneous evolution and
the mutual interdependence between art, engineering, and philosophy.
Theoretical innovations related to literary technique---the emphasis on on
language games, form, the morphology of narrative---develop simultaneously
with rapid change in the technologies of rule-based programmable media like
punch cards and ticker tape. The origins of computer science and literary
formalism can be traced back to a set of shared theoretical assumptions and
technological contingencies coming to fore of telecommunications at the turn
of the twentieth century.

It is at this time that the formalist concept of technique begins to remove
the idea of literary production from its affective, intimate, and
irreproducible contexts. The emphasis on craft over art implies primarily a
change in the artist's relationship to the modes of artistic production. Where
the artistic genius is unique, craft carries with it a model of inheritance.
Where genius is born, technique is shared. Where the artist labors alone, the
craftsman learns a trade in a workshop, as part of a collective. In a more
abstracted sense, we can view the turn to technique as a rejection of
Schopenhauer's aesthetics, which emphasised individual creative genius
reaching "beyond the objects which actually present themselves" towards the
transcendent ideal [@schopenhauer_world_1906, 249]. Formalism dispels the
illusion of creation, orienting the artist towards discovery through craft and
technique. In his "Art as Device," Shklovsky writes:

> The work of poetic schools amounts to the aggregation and the discovery of
> new devices/techniques [*priem*] for the arrangement and the processing of
> linguistic material, and, in particular, more so with the rearrangement of
> figure [*obraz*] rather than with its creation" [@shklovksy_poetika_1919,
> 102].

Unlike the previous generation of symbolist critics, the Russian formalists
did not think that poetics could be reduced to a type of figurative thinking.
Shklovsky and his fellow valued instead the "arrangement and the processing"
of literary trope. This line of reasoning brings Shklovsky to the idea of
linguistic "automatization." Prosaic, everyday language follows the "laws of
conservation of energy," he writes, paraphrasing the thesis of Herbert
Spencer's *The Philosophy of Style* [@spencer_philosophy_1892]. Shklovsky
writes that "in fluid, practical speech words are not pronounced fully" and
that "the mind barely perceives the initial sounds of each word." Shklovsky
calls this dynamic the "algebraization of language" [@shklovksy_poetika_1919,
105].  In algebraic thinking "thoughts are grasped through quantity and
capacity---we do not see them as such, but merely recognize them by cursory
characteristics" [@shklovksy_poetika_1919, 105]. The dynamics of
automatization conserve mental energy. Semantic complexity is reduced to a
compact formula. Estrangement, or the de-programming of received trope,
constitutes the primary technique of aesthetic discourse. The role of art and
analysis alike is to apprehend the thing, that is to undo the work of
symbolism, which continually substitutes the composite signifier for the
apparent unity of the sign. Estrangement arrests the algebraic optimization by
which short-hand symbols stand for complex things and ideas. Thus, were
prosaic everyday language follows the laws of conservation of energy, poetic
language expands energy to make language difficult again [*zatrudnenie*] and
to prolong attention [*vospriiatie*]. If language is a labor-saving device,
poetic language is labor-intensive.

Any innovation in the linguistic sphere is thus bound follow the cycle of
habituation and renewal, according to the formalists. With time, a literary
device capable of arresting attention itself becomes normalized and in need of
rejuvenation. Consequently, the evolution of aesthetic periods follow a course
of arbitrary differentiation. The dominant device in one period, becomes a
cliché in the next. Technique in that sense was seen by the formalists as a
type of information processing at the meta-linguistic, social level. The
mechanics of "arrangement and the rearrangement of figure" thus propel the
mechanics of literary development to produce new meaning within familiar
contexts.

In the 1920s, reflecting critically on Shklovsky's "materialist aesthetics"
Mikhail Bakhtin would write that the formal model of aesthetic genre formation
is at least capable of establishing a "chronological table of variance in the
evolution of technical devices, because "in isolation technique cannot have a
history" [@bakhtin_k_2003, 270-1]. Bakhtin was however careful not to reduce
technique to the questions of "material arrangement" alone. He wrote, "I am
quite ready to join in the sentiment that 'in art technique is all,' provided
we understand that the aesthetic object cannot exist independent of the
artistic work." For Bakhtin, the work existed neither in the mind nor in the
arrangement of matter [@bakhtin_k_2003, 308-10]. The idea of technique
therefore could not be reduced to formal manipulation, independent of the
aesthetic object. "In art, technique is not mechanistic," he wrote. "Technique
animates and motivates the aesthetic object at every point" [@bakhtin_k_2003,
310]. In this equation between the work of art as an idea and an object,
Bakhtin approximates the following formula: "the audience is equivalent to the
creator, minus technique." The audience thus recreates the creative process of
the making of the work of art, without quite grasping the material necessities
of creation. Alternatively, the author "equals the audience plus technique"
[@bakhtin_k_2003, 373-4]. For Bakhtin, technique serves as the "method of
processing content through material" [@bakhtin_k_2003, 249]. The ultimate goal
of poetics is therefore for Bakhtin the understanding of the work of art as a
"technical apparatus of aesthetic creation," a movement, in other words,
between the work of art as an idea and the object of art as a thing
[@bakhtin_k_2003, 275].

But even as formal analysis skirted the idea of a materialist
poetics---Bakhtin calls it "primitive" and "reductive" for this
inclination---the formalists stopped short of including the physical
properties of inscription into literary analysis. The "matter" of poetics was
nevertheless limited to the rather abstract notion of language, which still
seemed to exist independently of its physical manifestations. With this in
mind, it is interesting to consider Nabokov's recursive meta-poetics as a
logical apogee of the formalist program. Nabokov's pipes and surface
inscriptions protrude through the diegetic limits of the fictional world,
pointing to the book as an object. The nesting doll structure of literary
instrumentation ends at the book. Nabokov's prose reveals the surface of the
page as the outer-most literary device containing all other literary devices.
Despite its materialist ambitions, formal literary analysis only gestures
towards the object. Technique remains an intra-textual procedure. The material
affordances of the literary object are not seen as participating in the
dynamics of meaning making. The book itself recedes from view. In his
influential *The Craft of Fiction*, the English critic Percy Lubbock, himself
a formalist of sorts, would write echoing his Soviet colleagues:

> To grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of the book, to hold it fast, to
> turn it over and to survey it at leisure---that is the effort of a critic of
> books, and it is perpetually defeated [...] Nothing, no power, will keep the
> book steady and motionless before us so that we may have time to examine its
> shape and design [@lubbock_craft_1921, 1].

Make note of the object-oriented vocabulary in the above passage that does
note quite refer to the object. When Lubbock uses words like "form," "book,"
"shape," and "design" or when he refers to "grasping," "holding," and "keeping
the book motionless," he seem to refer to these concepts metaphorically as in
holding, grasping, and keeping the book before the mind's eye. The book
continually escapes the reader's mental not physical grasp. Our ability to
understand the novel as a form is hampered by our unfamiliarity with its
"technical aspects," Lubbock writes [@lubbock_craft_1921, 272]. Other more
plastic art forms like sculpture or painting can be grasped at once, in their
entirety. They exist at a time and at a place limited to their physical
dimensions. By contrast, the narrative unfolds in time. The novel must be
assembled before the mind's eye to present itself for analysis in its
entirety. Elements of composition unfold in time outside of the novel's
physical, bibliographic contexts. Meaning making of this sort involves reading
past the linguistic minutiae to construct a synthetic literary whole. Lubbock
writes that the "real heart and substance of the book [...] stands out more
clearly for the obscurity into which the less essential parts of it subside"
[@lubbock_craft_1921, 4]. To read in this mode is to deny the book its
materiality. To read the novel for pleasure is to "forget, if we can, that the
book is an object of art [@lubbock_craft_1921, 6]. And to forget the book as
an object of art is necessarily to forget it also as an object. Thus to
"objectify the elements" of the novel that "strike us more keenly," as Lubbock
phrases it, is precisely the opposite of what is normally meant by
objectification. Reading is a retreat from materiality. The book is a retreat
also from the material realities of the reader's immediate context, an escape
into the imagination, where the reader can "discover a world" and "be lost" in
a "pleasant illusion," where there is "no chance of our finding, perceiving,
recreating, the *form* of the book [emphasis mine]" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 6].

Unlike the lay reader, the critic's task is to engage in the particulates of
the writing craft. Lubbock writes that "far from losing ourselves in the world
of the novel, we must hold it away from us, see it all in detachment, and use
the whole of it to make the image we seek, the book itself"
[@lubbock_craft_1921, 6]. Echoing Boris Eichenbaum in "How *The Overcoat* is
Made", Lubbock calls the reader's attention to the technology or craft of
literary construction. He promises to view a "handful of familiar novels [...]
with some particularity," but without judgement or critique. "How they are
made is the only question I ask," he writes [@shklovksy_poetika_1919;
@lubbock_craft_1921, 12 & 28; @eichenbaum_how_1995]. "The author of the book
was a craftsman," he concludes. It is therefore the critic's role to "overtake
him at his work and see how the book was made" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 274].

Lubbock's usage of an object-oriented vocabulary---"parts," "forms," "shapes,"
"proportions," and "designs"---nevertheless refer to ideational, mental
constructs, just as it was for Shklovsky and Eichenbaum. "The book vanishes as
we lay our hands on it," Lubbock writes [@lubbock_craft_1921, 273]. Critics
must chose to see either the trees or the forest. As the totality of the work
comes into view, the technical details of craft---and the book
itself---disappear. But viewed up close, the technical particulates also
obscure sight of the work as a whole. *The Craft of Fiction* ends on an
ambivalent note, stopping short of recovering the book as an object. "If only
there was one single tangible and measurable fact about the book," Lubbock
writes. If only it could be "weighed like a statue" or "measured like a
picture, it would be a support in the world of shadows [@lubbock_craft_1921,
273-4].

Like Bakhtin and Lubbock before him, Walter Benjamin similarly develops a
notion of technique as a process that bridges immanence and transcendence: the
work of art as an idea and a thing. The work of art for Benjamin does not and
cannot exist in the mode of a "rigid, isolated object." Rather, "it must be
inserted into the context of living social relations," and therefore, into the
context determined by its relation to literary production
[@benjamin_author_1983, 87]. Authorship identifies a specific mode of
production. The question of formal, intra-textual figurative arrangements
within the work of art thus cannot be considered apart from their
extra-textual material contexts. Technique for Benjamin is what makes literary
products "accessible" to materialist analysis; technique itself is, in his
view, a relationship to production [@benjamin_author_1983, 87].

In making the characteristically Marxist move towards production, Benjamin
attempts to bridge what he calls the "sterile dichotomy" between form and
content [@benjamin_author_1983, 88]. Technique brings the arrangement of
literary, ideational content into accordance with its modes of production. By
these means the very concept of the author---what counts for authorship, what
is published---connects to the overall structure of the publishing industry
and the industry to the more general arrangements of labor and capital. In
this way the *idea* of citizen reporters, to take a Soviet example that he
uses, has the potential to democratize journalism. But, as long as the
production of newspapers is outside of the writer's immediate control, citizen
journalism is bound to remain, *in practice*, "an article of consumption." In
capitalist societies forces of capital ultimately transform the potential for
any meaningful political struggle brought about by the new narrative technique
into mere comfortable contemplation, a technically perfect object of enjoyment
[@benjamin_author_1983].

It seems not possible then for poetic form to evolve without the corresponding
evolution in the structures of literary production. Like Shklovsky, Benjamin
saw a small ray of hope in modernist techniques of estrangement and
interruption. Emerging art forms like photo-montage and the epic theater
puncture the illusion of artistic unity. "Epic theater does not reproduce
conditions," Benjamin writes; it is not mimetic, it "discloses" and
"uncovers." The technique of interruption, by which a playwright freezes the
scene, for example, functions to create a caesura within the structure of the
play. Similar to Lubbock's detached objectification of the novel and
Shklovsky's concept of estrangement, interruption brings attention to the
artifice of the art form. At the height of its powers, epic drama shows the
possibility of what Benjamin calls a "lasting alienation," by which the
effects of the dramatic interruption can persevere beyond theater, continuing
to expose the uncomfortable truths about the human condition
[@benjamin_author_1983, 99-102].

In traditional Marxist terms, the dilemma of robotics---automated machinery of
thought and war---rests on an understanding of production as it relates to its
cognates: authorship, technique, craft, poiesis. Even in those cases when
authors write freely, without duress, they do not choose their instruments.
Readers also determine the contexts of their own meaning making only in part.
"The means of production do not depend on the free will," Marx wrote
[@marx_collected_1976, 181; @winner_autonomous_1978, 83]. It is not enough
therefore to be an independent supplier of commodities, a free agent. One must
also be free to develop new *ways of producing*. The liberated writer must
transform, in Benjamin's words, from the "supplier" of technique into an
"engineer," able to adapt the literary apparatus towards one's own ends
[@benjamin_author_1983, 102]. At stake as always in materialist poetics is the
self-determination of the subject. Technique liberates literature from
individual genius, but in doing so it also enters the commons, beyond the
reach of the individual. Following this logic, formalist poetics necessitate a
kind of a structuralism, which proceeds in search of universal constructs like
Vladimir Propp's narrative folk motifs or the universal grammar of Noam
Chomsky. These rule-based structures exist in the space previously occupied in
the space of the Hegelian world spirit, a kind of a worldly meta-consciousness
that seems to develop by its own laws and logic.

### 2.2 Thought Experiment I

These broad strokes towards the intellectual history of the literary device
bring us to literary devices as they exist today, precisely within the
confusion between symbol and thing. At this point, it becomes productive to
examine the history of modern computing not within its usual lineage of
calculating machinery, but in relation to the broader history of symbolism
which encompasses both poetic and computational devices. The modern
computer---and by extension the electronic book---harkens back to a cluster of
related thought experiments prevalent in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein
and subsequently to the ideas of Alan Turing, his long-time student and
colleague. The story of Turing machines has been told before in many guises,
but never with an eye towards literary machines that nevertheless occupy a
central place in the early development of modern computing.

To confront the computer as a literary device, a machine optimized for
symbolic exchange, one must first understand its peculiar relationship to
universal Turing machines. I would like to take some time now to draw two
further as yet unexplored historical lineages that lead to Turing's seminal
essay on computable numbers: the first intellectual, stemming back to his
tutelage under Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the second material, highlighting the
physical similarities between Turing's design and a number of concomitant
developments in printing and communication. To read Turing and Wittgenstein
together is to recover a legacy of humanities computing that often gets
overlooked in the critical literature on the subject. This history is
important because it allows us to see the simulated book in a new light: not
as byproduct of quantification, but as a metaphor machine, capable of
universal symbolic manipulation. Turing machines should hold interest for
literary scholars because they present a minimally viable model for
generalized symbolic manipulation: reading and writing. Although the thought
experiment they embody solves a mathematical problem, the thought experiment
itself has roots in a more general discussion about the nature of
interpretation, central to questions of meaning-making in art and culture.

In his seminal 1936 paper on computable numbers, Alan Turing, then a student
at King's College, proposed a peculiar thought experiment to appear on the
pages of mathematical journal. The experiment addressed a problem in the field
of elementary number theory [^ln1-anticipate]. His solution involved more than
a formula. Instead, he imagined a machine that would in some real sense take
place of the calculation. Ultimately, Turing described a device that was meant
to *embody* they symbol: it transformed external abstractions into physical
states, internal to the device. In doing so, this imagined machine breached
the boundary between idea and matter. It was exactly an instrument for
transforming ideas into shapes: the very process at the heart of materialist
aesthetics. In this sense, Turing's hypothetical machine represents the
conclusion of a long-standing thought experiment concerning the nature of
human understanding, particularly as it relates to hermeneutics---the
interpretation of written texts.

The question of "automated" hermeneutics echoes through the canon of Western
philosophical tradition. What does it mean to read and to understand
something? Is it enough to repeat the words of another, as Phaedrus does in
response to Socrates?  Would an animal or a machine be said to possess reason
if it could parrot human speech, as it was for Descartes who wrote that it
would not be sufficient for the "reasoned soul" to be "lodged in the human
body like a pilot of a ship, except perhaps to move its members," but that
intelligence must be "more closely joined and united with the body to produce
true feelings and appetites" [@descartes_discourse_1996]? Recall also the
experiments with combinatorial poetics of the 17th century German Jesuit
scholar Athanasius Kircher, the inventor of *Arca Musurgicae*, a music
composition device, by which a composer not versed in music would combine
predetermined musical phrases written on wooden planks to compose a score.

![Kircher's *Arca Musurgicae*, the musical composition box, 1650
[@kircher_musurgia_1999, 184].](images/music-box.jpg)

In correspondence with Kircher, the German Baroque poet Quirinus Kuhlman
argued that using such an instrument to compose music or poetry would amount
to "*sed versûs, non poëma* [mere versification, not poetry]." Would we call a
naive child using such a contraption a composer or a poet, he asked? And
answered:

> Sed lusus est ingeniosus, Ingeniose Kirchere, non methodus, prima fronte
> aliquid promittens, in recessu nihil solvens. Sine cista enim puer nihil
> potest respondere, & in cista nihil praeter verba intelligit; tot profert,
> quot audit, sine intellectu...

> But [the poetry box] is just an ingenious game, ingenious Kircher, not a
> method, promising something on the surface, but solving nothing deep down.
> For without the box the boy can answer nothing, and with the box he
> understands nothing but words. He produces whatever he hears, without
> understanding, like a parrot [@gillespie_primal_1978, 32].

Without the box the child cannot create. Like the parrot of Descartes he
mimics creation, on the surface without the corresponding deep structures. In
the latter half of the 20th century, the philosopher John Searle would ask a
similar question in his famous Chinese Room thought experiment
[@searle_minds_1980]. Can a contraption be said to "speak" a language if
inside it contains only a dictionary for looking up the correct answers to any
given query? His answer was again, no. The room cannot speak a language in the
way a fluent speaker can. The external signs of whatever is meant by
"speaking" and "understanding" must correspond to the appropriate internal
mental states [@searle_minds_1980]. Plato, Descartes, Kuhlman, and Searle all
pose a version of the same thought experiment, which aims to draw a line
between the surface appearance of knowledge and "deep understanding." Reading
should, these thinkers intuit, leave something behind. A text must be somehow
"joined and united" with the body and to continue to produce meaning,
independent of the original inscription. The inside and the outside should
stand in accordance.

Recall the famous *pharmakon* passage from Plato's *Phaedrus*, which explores
the relationship between type and mental impression. At the conclusion of the
dialog, King Thamus objects to the technology (*ta tekhnēs*) of the written
word, as he believes it will foster forgetfulness in the people who use it.
Plato writes: "Their faith in extrinsic writing [*graphō exōthen*], by means
of foreign impressions [*allotrion tupōn*] will diminish their intrinsic
[*endothen autous*] capacity to remember" [@plato_plato:_1999].[^ln1-platotr]
Plato thus contrasts the exterior figure [*graphō exōthen*] with the intrinsic
[*endothen*] human capacity to remember. The Greek *tupōn*, related to the
English "type," literally means an impression. And in this case it is
"foreign" or "othered" [*allotrion*]. It comes from without. Like Moreno after
him, Thamus finds thought externalized through typography problematic. True
memory and thought for them both must come from within: it must be autopoietic
and not allopoietic activity. For this reason, Socrates asks the young man to
stop reciting the speech by heart. He wants Phaedrus to think for himself and
not to merely regurgitate the thought of another. To truly understand
something and to make a show of their comprehension, readers must do more than
read: they must internalize. Much can go wrong in that process, but we expect
for reading to ultimately leave an appropriate impression [*tupōn*] on the
reader's mental state. For understanding to take place, writing must produce
"true" feelings and appetites, in the words of Descartes. But what is true,
appropriate, or proper?  What does it mean to properly internalize an
inscription?---that is the profound mystery always present even in the most
mundane acts of reading and writing.

Turing's machine must be understood first in the general context of this
broader tradition and second as a specific response to a series of thought
experiments proposed by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the 1930s at King's College,
Cambridge where Turing attended as a student and later as an
instructor.[^ln1-timeline] Wittgenstein broached the problem of reading
machines and comprehension first in *The Blue and Brown Books* along with
*Philosophical Grammar* (all compiled in the early 1930s), then in his
lectures and remarks on the foundations of psychology and mathematics from the
late 1930s, and finally in *Philosophical Investigations*, written between
1945 and 1949.

The earliest of these documents, *The Blue Book*, begins with a question of
interpretation. "What is a meaning of a word?" Wittgenstein asks. And from the
start, he cautions his students against choosing the easy answer, which holds
that meaning resides in the head. Wittgenstein writes:

> It is misleading then to talk of thinking as of a "mental activity". We may
> say that thinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. This
> activity is performed by the hand, when we think by writing; by the mouth
> and larynx, when we think by speaking; and if we think by imaging signs or
> pictures, I can give you no agent that thinks. If then you say that in such
> cases the mind thinks, I would only draw your attention to the fact that you
> are using metaphor, that here the mind is the agent in a different sense
> from that in which the hand can be said to be the agent in writing
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 6-7].

Wittgenstein explains that when we see a sentence on paper, the external
manifestation of a thought, we assume that some analogous structure exists
somewhere in the brain. Perhaps, Wittgenstein speculates, we could even
observe the brain directly, in the process of writing. Both phenomena, brain-
and paper- bound, could properly be called the expression of thought. Yet
neither make sense in isolation. Rather, we are witnessing the workings of a
metaphor: a transference of properties between two distinct locations, one in
the head and one on paper. Neither physical nor mental descriptions of these
processes alone are sufficient to locate cognition. The subject escapes
depending on our point of view. When the hand writes, it is the brain that
thinks. But when the hand thinks, it is the brain that writes. One must
understand both sides of the equation. Meaning in that sense lies in the
transition from the hand to the head and from mind to paper: "Where does
thinking take place?" he asks. It takes place "on paper, in our head, in the
mind." But, "none of these statements of locality gives *the* locality of
thinking" [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16].

"Can a machine think?" Wittgenstein asks later on in the first notebook
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16]. The problem, as he explains, is not one of
finding a machine that can do the job---of manipulating signs, for example.
It lies in the ability of a machine to enact the both sides of the metaphoric
equation. "Doing the job," the manipulation of signs, must correspond to
something else. Severed from some other analogical structure, the "blind"
manipulation of signs is a meaningless activity. Meaning, Wittgenstein seems
to suggest, resides simply in this analogy between something (symbol) and
something else (mechanism). The question then can be better rephrased as "can
a machine have private mental states?" Can it feel pain in the sense of pain
being a state of internal affairs not accessible to others
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16, 46-9]? We return to the correspondence between
the internal and the external. Characteristically for Wittgenstein, the
notebooks pose more questions than they answer.

Wittgenstein extends his thought experiments about thinking machines in his
*Brown Notebook.* Let us study the word "reading," he suggests early on. By
reading, he means the activity of "translating script into sounds," "of
writing according to dictation," or "of copying in writing a page of print"
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 119]. Reading once again is "mechanical" reading,
without a sense of "understanding" or interpretation. What happens when a
child reads a newspaper, for example? "His eyes glide along the printed words,
he pronounces them aloud or to himself, but other words he pronounces after
having seen their first few letters only, other again he reads out letter by
letter." The child acts as a "reading machine" when he pays no attention to
what he reads, even when he speaks the words out loud. Yet he reads
"faultlessly like a reliable machine." Another child merely pretends to read.
He guesses at the words, and on occasion repeats things "by heart", without
actually seeing them on the page [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 121-22]. Should
either of these count as reading?

Wittgenstein continues to complicate such edge cases, challenging his
audience's intuitions of what it means to read and to understand. He gives
also the example of a hallucinating patient, who "reads" what to us looks like
gibberish, and the case of man who fakes reading Cyrillic by memorizing the
lines phonetically. He talks of machines too, which produce random sounds that
occasionally, by accident, correspond to some existing texts. In each case, we
envision two mechanisms, Wittgenstein writes, one visible and external and one
hidden and internal. To read, the reader must do more than go through the
motions of reading. Instead, we erroneously privilege the inward-facing signs
of comprehension as the "real criterion for a person's reading or not
reading." Neither are outward signs sufficient to indicate reading and
comprehension. The physical motions, of gliding one's eyes across the page and
saying the words out loud, must connect in some way with appropriate internal,
mental representations.

But in fact no such internal mechanisms can be known to us or communicated to
others properly [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120]. We can only intuit the
reader's private experience of reading, or whether such reading attains the
desired correspondence between inward state and outward sign. A reading pupil
must convince his teacher that the scanned sign had the intended effect. This
requires more words in a sort of an interrupted hermeneutic circle, the two
sides of which do not quite connect to complete the communication feedback
circuit. To convince Socrates that he did more than memorize the words,
Phaedrus must use more words, which are similarly unconvincing. What if those
are memorized as well? What can we do to convince others that we have properly
understood a text?

Wittgenstein finally describes the mechanisms of reading as an "indirect way
of transmitting a feeling." "Something that we can never know happens at the
other end" of the communication act [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 185].
Communication, as we would say today, is always mediated. In conclusion of the
notebooks, Wittgenstein imagines the possibility of unmediated, "direct" modes
communication, capable of transmitting feelings from one person to another.
We are ultimately limited by private sensations of knowledge. Any sense of
affirmation comes through further expression entailing further uncertainty.

Thought experiments in *The Blue and Brown Notebooks* do not amount to a
cohesive model of communication, semiotics, or the mind. They do however
contain the seeds of the reading and writing machines later imagined by Alan
Turing and subsequently passed into the foundations of computer science.
Wittgenstein's experimental thought machines prefigure the modern computer.
Wittgenstein conjures these fantastical broken mechanisms of comprehension
ultimately to address the problem of symbolic interpretation.

*Philosophical Grammar,* written around the same time as the *Blue and Brown
Notebooks*, gives us another glimpse into the pre-history of the literary
device. It begins again with a problem of "understanding" and "not
understanding." "To understand language," Wittgenstein writes, means "to take
in symbolism as a whole" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 5]. From the very
first passages, Wittgenstein envisions "understanding" as a type of
trans-mediation. In comparing the understanding of language propositions to
music, he writes: "for explanation I can only translate the musical picture
into a picture in another medium and let one picture throw light on the other"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 5 & 41]. And elsewhere: "How curious: we
should like to explain the understanding of a gesture as a *translation* into
words, and the understanding of words as a translation into gestures [emphasis
mine]" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 42]. In conclusion, he again
describes what we mean by "understanding" as a "process of translation from
one symbolism into another; tracing a picture, copying something, or
translating into another mode of representation"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 45]. To understand something said is akin
to modeling it in clay or drawing, he writes. There understanding comes
through the comparative use of both modes of representation.

In light of our earlier discussion about metaphoric transference,
Wittgenstein's hermeneutics can be understood as a type of metaphor making,
across media. To comprehend something, it is not enough to paraphrase it in
the same medium. It seems that language cannot be explained in language, for
example. One must trade symbolisms, creating a metaphor that explains one
representational system in terms of another. This process is not exact. How
would one check if the "clay model" corresponds to the "language model"
properly, for example? In thinking of the various ways in which the process of
translation breaks, Wittgenstein continually returns to the pianola, a type of
a player piano. In the player piano, the relationship between music score
sheet and the keyboard is rigidly defined. Perforated sheet music passes
through the machine, activating a set of corresponding pins. The conceptual
world of the mechanism and the conceptual world of music notation correspond
exactly. The machine enacts the metaphor through rigid connections. We are
guaranteed correspondence in a sense. But like the other mechanisms, the
pianola can break too.

![Electrically-operated musical instrument by Clyde Coleman of Chicago, Il.
1914, US1107495A.](images/pianola.png)

In the early passages of *Philosophical Grammar*, Wittgenstein explains:
"Aren't our sentences parts of a mechanism? As in a pianola? But suppose it is
in bad condition?  So it is not the effect but the purpose of the signs (the
holes in the pianola roll). Their purpose *within* the mechanism"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 10]. Wittgenstein elaborates a few pages
later:

> The sentences that we utter have a particular purpose, they are to produce
certain effects. They are parts of a mechanism, perhaps a psychological
mechanism, and the words of the sentences are also parts of the mechanism
(levers, cogwheels, and so on). The example that seems to illustrate what
we're thinking of here is an automatic music player, a pianola. It contains a
roll, rollers, etc., on which the piece of music is written is some kind of
notation (the position of holes, pegs, and so on). It's as if the written sign
gave orders which are carried out by keys and hammers
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 69].

As was the case with reading automata in *The Blue and Brown Notebooks*,
Wittgenstein again substitutes a physical mechanism for the process of
symbolic interpretation. In this view, words and music notation alike, have "a
purpose" to elicit some "effects" in the interpretive mechanism. But as
before, we cannot always expect the mechanism of interpretation to function
properly, nor do we have a reliable way to check its operation. "Suppose the
pianola is in bad condition," Wittgenstein repeats. The signs on the roll
could produce "hisses and bangs" instead of music, for example. One could
object that notes are always "meant" to play on a mechanism in perfect working
order. But to explain what is meant, we would need to draw yet another diagram
or build another machine. By analogy, the "sense" of an "order"---the
programming instructions of the piano roll---lies in its "effect on an
obedient man" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 60-70]. The pianola
exemplifies ultimately belongs to a class of controlling mechanism. In good
working order it is ultimately obedient to the instructions. Metaphors control
in the sense of mediating precise state changes between two disparate
conceptual systems, in this case, the notches of the piano roll and the
actuating mechanisms of the player piano.

When drawing the analogy between mental and mechanical processes, Wittgenstein
explicitly rejects the model of language as a "psychophysical" mechanism.
Rather, as the title of the work suggests, Wittgenstein is in search for the
"grammar" governing the engagement: between speakers and listeners, readers
and writers, player pianos and musical scores. By the end of the work, grammar
emerges as a set of "conventions." Wittgenstein complicates the mechanism by
inserting an extra layer of "rules" that mediate between symbol and machine or
mental state. A convention could be agreed upon and transcribed in a chart,
for example. And it is possible that "there is a part of the mechanism which
resembles the chart, and is inserted between the language-part of the
mechanism and the rest of it" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 190]. We are
back again to imagining some set of instructions that could enforce strict
compliance between the instructions and the actuating parts of the mechanisms.
In the programming parlance he proposes something like a language interpreter,
which would complain if the machine instructions were not entered properly or
if the machine failed to meet its specified obligations. "Imagine a language
consisting of commands," Wittgenstein writes in conclusion. It is to direct a
human "forwards," "back," "right," and "left," "quickly" and "slowly"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 197] The grammar, like a table of
correspondences, explains the meaning of the signs. In this way, we can move
away from speaking of "intended effects" or "proper obedience," and rather
concentrate on the mediating layer that describes the rules of engagement.

### 2.3 Thought Experiment II

Turing met Wittgenstein at King's College sometime in the 1930s. Although
there are no records of them meeting explicitly until Turing's attendance of
Wittgenstein's lectures on the foundation of mathematics in 1939
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 7], both men's work exhibits sustained
attention to computing machines narrowly and to the mechanical manipulation of
symbols more generally. From the notes on Wittgenstein's lectures complied and
published by Cora Diamond, it is clear that Turing was a vociferous presence
in the class. His name is mentioned eighty-six times in the text, more than
any other student by a wide margin.[^ln1-margin] At some point of the course
Wittgenstein concludes his lecture in saying: "Unfortunately, Turing will be
away from the next lecture, and therefore that lecture will have to be
somewhat parenthetical. For it is not good my getting the rest to agree to
something that Turing would not agree to" [@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976,
67-68].

Like the notebooks beforehand, Wittgenstein structures his lectures around the
problem of symbolic interpretation. "I am going to talk about the
interrelation of mathematical symbols," Wittgenstein begins. We imagine that
logical laws represent some sort of "fixed" mechanisms "behind" the symbols
used to express them. "I am speaking against the idea of logical machinery,"
Wittgenstein says in lecture XX. "The idea of logical machinery would suppose
that there was something behind our symbols"
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 194]. We imagine logic to be a sort of a
"rigid mechanism" that can only turn this way or the other. "Any rule can be
imagined to be a description of a mechanism---even the rule which says a pawn
must not be moved in a certain way," Wittgenstein writes
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 282]. The parts of the mechanism
subsequently exist in a causal relationship to one another. Pushing this or
that lever will *always* result in such and such movement, because of the way
the mechanical parts are connected. We say that the mechanism is rigid or the
law is inexorable, when the results of an action are absolutely fixed.
Wittgenstein calls such a relationships "super-hardness." Where a judge can be
lenient, he explains, the law is compulsory. What we would now call "an
algorithm" compels predictable execution.

We are tempted, as before, to privilege the inner workings of the symbolic
mechanism, also at the core of meaning making in mathematics. "If I show you
the mechanism behind the [watch] dial, you will be able to predict the
movement of the hour hand for any given movement of the minute hand,"
Wittgenstein writes. "And you will not be sceptical." Yet even there, we would
be making an assumption about a mechanism that *functions well*. "For
instance, I may drop the clock" Wittgenstein explains, "so that the machinery
is broken, or a lighting may strike it [@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976,
195]. How are we to know if the mechanism functions properly or not? For that
we would need "a picture" or some sort of schematics that describe what the
proper mechanism should look like. The mechanism is in fact itself a type of a
symbol for the perfected behavior of the sort that we expect. Where we tried
to find the mechanism behind the symbol, we found also the symbol behind the
mechanism. Once again we struggle to complete the circuit of interpretation
between intent and effect, which never quite manage to explain and to verify
each other.

In his lectures on mathematics, Wittgenstein never finds a way out of this
conundrum. The foundations of mathematics rely on some such mutually dependent
relationship between the physical and the symbolic worlds. Whether it is in
math or in ordinary language, some magic happens at the coupling of the matter
and sign. The precise point of contact concerns Wittgenstein in all fields of
human activity, from literature to psychology and mathematics.

In all of these fields, Wittgenstein finds an implicit analogy between
"symbol" and "mechanism." A type of metaphor, the analogy itself is atomic. It
cannot be split further into something like "sign" and "referent" or the
"signifier" and the "signified." Considered apart, the two parts of the
metaphor are strictly meaningless. In his lectures on aesthetics, Wittgenstein
describes such a semiotic relationship as the "concomitance between mechanism
and its trace" [@wittgenstein_lectures_1966, 16]. In giving an account of
one's aesthetic judgment, the best we can do is to "trace a mechanism"
[@wittgenstein_lectures_1966, 13].

It would be a mistake however to reduce Wittgenstein's semiotics to the
mechanical theory of the mind. Rather, in presenting his students and readers
with a number of hypothetical machines, Wittgenstein attempts to discover the
"rule book" of what he later calls language games---or at lest to suggest that
such a rulebook might exist. Much has been written on this aspect of
Wittgenstein's thought and its relation to Bertrand Russel's symbolic logic
and subsequently to Chomsky's development of "universal grammar." In the
context of our conversation, Wittgenstein's "middle period" is important for
its direct influence on Turing's model of computation.

Several prominent characteristics pass from Wittgenstein's reading machines to
Turing's universals. First, the symbolic machine emerges from the
metaphor-like correspondence between internal machine state and external
symbolic representation. Second, Wittgenstein discusses symbolic
representation in terms of its delayed effects, that is, ultimately, a type of
a remote control mechanism. And finally, Wittgenstein imagines a mediating
layer that holds the rules for translation between state and symbol. All of
these features, along with a collection of hypothetical machines in various
states of disrepair, pass directly from Wittgenstein to Turing.

Turing's machine offers a strikingly minimalist response to the legacy of
automated hermeneutics. His universal machine subsumes all of Wittgenstein's
examples, forming the minimally-viable blueprint for generalized symbolic
manipulation. To function, Turing's machine needs only the following three
components: (a) a storage medium capable of holding symbolic inscription, (b)
a reading and writing mechanism to operate on the symbols, and (c) a way to
transform external symbolic states into internal states of the mechanism.
Given these three characteristics, the machine becomes a universal mechanism.
The universal Turing machine can take on the function of any other machine, as
long as that machine's state is amenable to symbolic representation.  The
universal machine takes machine states as its input. It is a machine that
"traces the mechanism" of all other metaphoric mechanisms. In this lies the
essence of Turing computation.

Turing begins his paper suggestively: "we may compare a man in the process of
computing a real number to a machine that is only capable of a finite number
of conditions." [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. In effect, he asks his readers
to compare computation, a human mental process, to the mechanical action of a
machine. As Charles Petzold explained it in his book-length annotation on
Turing's paper, Turing "makes reference to 'states of mind' that are analogous
to machine states" [@petzold_annotated_2008, 67]. When read in the context of
Wittgenstein's thought experiments, it becomes clear that the analogy itself
is a kind of a provocation. Neither mathematicians nor philosophers of mind
agreed then nor do they agree now on the extent to which states of mind can be
compared to discrete machine states. Turing provocatively slides into the
language of cognition to reinforce the analogy between mind and mechanism. His
machines "think" and his humans "compute."

Turing further imagines a machine "supplied with a 'tape' (the analogue of
paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called 'squares') each
capable of bearing a 'symbol'" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. Much like a
movie reel, the tape moves through the mechanism one section at a time. At
each point only one section bearing one symbol can be said to be "in the
machine." "We may call this square the 'scanned square,'" Turing writes,

> The symbol on the scanned square may be called the "scanned symbol." The
> "scanned symbol" is the only one of which the machine is, so to speak,
> "directly aware" [@turing_computable_1937, 231].

The scanned symbol becomes a part of the machine's internal configuration, or
to slide into the cognitive vocabulary along with Turing a part of its
"awareness." In Turing's words, "the machine can effectively remember [!] some
of the symbols which it has 'seen' (scanned) previously"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The machine's "behavior" is therefore
determined by its initial configuration---the arrangement of tape and
scanning apparatus---plus the scanned symbol. The scanned symbol becomes a
part of machine "memory." In contemporary language we would say that the
software turns into hardware, and the other way around.

We imagine then a device not unlike a telegraph or a film projector, which
ingests reels of tape. But unlike telegraphs or film projectors, the ingested
symbolic representation becomes effectively, by definition, a part of the
machine's internal state in a way that telegraph tape or film reels do not
when it comes to telegraphs and film projectors. The film reel and the ticker
tape pass through the mechanism without leaving a trace. The tape of the
Turing machine alters the machine configuration. If you recall Wittgenstein's
earlier thought experiments in this vein, he too spoke of human in the process
of reading or doing mathematics who similarly "ingest" symbols. He similarly
spoke of the need to internalize symbols, affecting a change in brain states
on some real and empirically observable neurological level. Turing's machine
is capable of similar internalization. It "thinks," "reads," and "remembers"
to the extent of its capability to scan and internalize symbolic inscription.
The Turing machine in effect gives us a concise minimally viable definition of
"reading" and "becoming aware." Proper reading involves the appropriate
internalization of the symbol, for both human and machine. The machine does
not just scan, it "reads" in the Platonic sense, able to convert ideal forms
into their specific physical instantiations.

In addition to "reading," Turing's machine must be able to write. Turing
writes that "in some configurations in which the scanned square is blank
(*i.e.* bears no symbol) the machine writes down a new symbol on the scanned
square" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The machine can also erase and move
symbols to adjacent squares, one square at a time. Reading, writing, and
symbolic manipulation are actions at the core of Turing's computation.  More
than just reading, machine reading is capable of altering the rules of
scansion. If we take "reading" to initially entail "moving our eyes from left
to right," the Turing machine is able to also ingest symbol that stand for
instructions like "now move from right to left." The configuration state of
the machine determines the movement of the "reading" and "writing" apparatus
along the surface of the tape. In this action, some of the scanned symbols
represent computable numbers, or data as we would say today, on which
computation is performed. Yet other symbols represent machine instructions,
which define the rules of computation. These type of instructional symbols
direct the movement of the reading and writing head. They tell the machine to
"write," "scan," or "erase" symbols. Today, we would call such instructions
"programs" or "control codes." The control codes and the computed data form a
part of the same continuous stream of information. Computation, in the Turing
sense, entails the transference between symbolic and solid states of being.

Just as the Turing machine is able to convert symbolic representation into
internal configuration states, it can conversely enact the opposite movement,
by representing internal configuration states symbolically. This remarkable
property allows for the creation of what Turing calls a class of universal
machines. Specific Turing machines could be configured to preform specific
actions like addition or multiplication. But the multiplication machine could
not, for example, be reconfigured for another purpose, because the physical
movement of its internals is fixed. An electronic scale, for example, is built
for one purpose only. It cannot be used for word processing or the calculation
of missile trajectory. An adding machine can only add. The universal Turing
machine has the ability to internalize *other machine configurations*.  Such a
machine can "compute any computable sequence" [@turing_computable_1937, 241].
In being able to internalize physical configuration as symbol, the *universal*
Turing machine can simulate all other special-purpose Turing machines, as long
as these machines can be represented symbolically and ingested. For this
reason, Turing computation excludes mechanical actions like hammering nails or
harvesting grain. The Turing machine simulates all other symbolic
manipulations. The transition of symbols into machine states (and the other
way around) defines modern programming. A universal machine, unlike other,
definitive, single-purpose and limited-state mechanisms (a clock for example),
contains the ability to take on differing internal symbolic configurations. It
can imitate a clock, an abacus, a scale, a book. In a later paper linking
computing machinery and intelligence, Turing implies it could eventually
simulate human thought as well [@turing_computing_1950].[^ln1-compete]

The universal Turing machine finally encapsulates a model of computation
itself. It computes anything computable. In substituting the concept of
computability with "effective computability" Turing's paper belongs to the
annals of mathematical theory. But, it continues to elicit conflicting
responses widely because much of it contains also the tantalizing
possibilities that bare on symbolic manipulation generally, including human
cognition. From the beginning we are asked to consider the similarity between
humans and machines in the process of computation. Turing consistently
describes machine states in terms of "states of mind," "awareness," and
"memory." These descriptions hint at the impact of computation more broadly,
beyond mathematical theory. Besides mathematical proof, the paper offers an
experimental, ludic even, enterprise in the spirit of Wittgestein's playful
experimentation which often involve altered states of mind, drugs, delirium,
madness, and outright deception.

Reconstructing the influence of Wittgenstein's thought on Turing confirms the
place of Turing's "On Computability" in the conversation about language, pain,
and cognition. Seen in the light of Wittgenstein's philosophy, Turing's work
and consequently the early history of computing acquires a broader
connotation, beyond the narrow confines of the *Entscheidungsproblem*, the
problem the paper addressed explicitly. In 1936, on the eve of World War II,
Turing imagined more than a formula: it was a thing that could explore the
limits of theory, and a theory that identified a new class of emerging things.
Through Turing's well-documented involvement in Government Code and Cypher
School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, actual Turing machines changed the nature of
war: used at first to break encrypted military communications and then to
compute missile trajectories. But as I have argued here, Turing machines also
changed humanity's relationship with symbolic thought. They belong to mode of
distinctly humanist thinking about reading, writing, and interpretation.


Wittgenstein struggles to answer that question in his lectures, where Turing
machine enacts it with blunt force.  The Turing machine ingests symbols,
incorporating them as part of its internal structure.

I revisit the lines from Plato's well-worn dialogue because Turing's paper
presents considerable difficulties to the non-mathematically-inclined reader.
Yet it becomes more accessible when considered in the philosophic lineage of
Plato, Wittgenstein, and Derrida: all three concerned with the movement of
inscription between internal and external spaces. I want us to view computers
and programming not only as products of electrical engineering but also as
part of a persistent thought in Western culture about the ultimate relation
between symbol and comprehension.

What does it mean to understand a sign?---that is the larger question that
Turing addresses. And, as we will see in the following passages, a direct
connection exists between Wittgenstein's hermeneutics and Turing's ideas about
computation. Steeped in the intellectual context of Cambridge, the evolution
of their thought overlaps the search for intrinsic structure in fields as
diverse as literary studies and anthropology. Turing's ideas about symbolic
manipulation acquire a new meaning when considered against the background of
formalism and structuralism, developing in Europe at the same time.

It is precisely because Turing paper left so much non-mathematical residue in
the wake of its publication that it continues to be a source of debate,
misunderstanding, and controversy to the present day. Consider the following
attempts to describe the essence of Turing computation:

> Turing machine, n. A notional computing machine for performing simple
> reading, writing, and shifting operations in accordance with a prescribed
> set of rules, invoked in theories of computability and automata
[@_turing_2015].

> a criterion [...] that it shall be possible to to devise a computing
> machine, occupying a finite space, and with working parts of finite size
[@church_computable_1937, 42].

> a human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit
> instructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine
[@church_computable_1937, 43].

> To understand a Turing machine we need only know its table of commands
[@kemeny_man_1955].

> A Turing machine plus random elements is a reasonable model for the human
> brain
[@putnam_issues_1961, 39].

> No Turing machine has ever been physically constructed or realized in
> hardware as a device for its own sake, but general-purpose digital computers
> have been programmed to simulate Turing machines
[@jordain_condensed_1969, 550; @_turing_2015].

In reading the above passages, one discovers a range of possible definitions.
The *Oxford English Dictionary* discusses Turing's original experiment in
terms of "a notational machine." It "performs operations" according to "a
prescribed set of rules." In short, the machine at least seems like a machine,
not unlike a steam engine or a mechanized doll. By contrast, Alonzo Church,
who was one of the first to read and to respond to Turing's paper, describes
it as a "criterion" for building a machine, not the machine itself. More
confusingly, it seems that a human armed with a pen and paper can already
satisfy Turing's criteria. Writing for the *Scientific American* in the
fifties, John Kemeny likens it to a "table of commands." In his reflection, it
seems neither a device nor a human being but an algorithm or a set of
instructions. A decade later, Hilary Putnam (along with a number of prominent
philosophers of mind) returns to Turing's paper to find a model of human
cognition.[@fodor_language_1975; @putnam_representation_1988]. Writing for one
of the earliest encyclopedias on computing, Philip Jordain finally
encapsulates the paradox at the heart of Turing computation: it is a device
that can never be constructed, yet all other computers are programmed in its
image.

A mechanism, an idea, an algorithm---imitating a human or imitated by
humans---an impossible ideal or just a ordinary person holding a pencil, the
Turing machine traces a figure somewhere between the ideal and the physical
worlds. The indeterminacy of computation blurs the boundaries between the
physical and the symbolic worlds. Turing continues to strike a controversial
figure at the fault lines separating theory from practice: computer science
and electrical engineering. The Turing machine "abstracts away from the
complexity of real computer architectures," Thomas Haigh writes for the
*Communications of Computing Machinery*. The historian should avoid confusing
hardware and software, he concludes [@haigh_actually_2014]. No matter how hard
computer science tries to escape into the realm of pure mathematics, Haigh
suggests, the limits of physical engineering pull it back to the sphere of the
applied.[^ln1-cs] Part real mechanism and part dream; part physics and part
metaphysics, the Turing machine should be encountered on its own terms.


### 2.3 Instrument

Literature in computer science tends to see universal Turing machines as
algorithms: in other words, as virtual, second-order symbolic representations.
Yet it is impossible to entirely disassociate the implementation from the idea.
In his review of Turing's "On Computable Numbers" paper, Alonzo Church, the
American mathematician whose work anticipated Turing's (independently) in
several important aspects, later wrote that "a human calculator, provided with
pencil and paper and explicit instructions can be regarded as a kind of a
Turing machine" [@church_computable_1937, 42-3; also cited in
@petzold_annotated_2008, 63]. Disregarding the broader, metaphysical
implications of that statement, note for now the persistence of two essential
implements required for the minimally viable operation of the Church--Turing
human and machine calculators. Pen and paper assert themselves through the
abstraction.[^ln1-abstraction]

What are we to make of universal Turing machines implemented in virtual worlds
like *Wireworld* (a cellular automaton simulation), or *Minecraft* (a procedurally
generated sand-box world-exploration game)?

![Universal Turing machine as an idea. "Nick Gardner's *Wireworld* multiplier,
via a Turing machine."](images/turing-idea.png)

At the very least, we must admit that such simulations cannot rest on the
proverbial "turtles all the way down," unless that is, one believes that the
universe itself is a type of a Turing machine [@deutsch_quantum_1985;
@lloyd_ultimate_2000; @piccinini_computational_2007]. At some point, the
virtual world simulation meets the limitations of the physical world. Until
physicists agree on the ultimate nature of the universe as computation (or
not), we continue to assume that Turing simulations comprise second-order
ideational constructs, floating on top of first-order physical mechanisms. In
the case of *Wireworld* and *Minecraft* the simulation "runs" on personal
computers. The physical capabilities of the bottom-most device limit the
computation power of all *n+1* order Turing simulations. Consequently, the
simulated UTM cannot outperform (in terms of cycles per second, instructions
per cycle, or its capacity to hold a number of instructions) the machine
executing the simulation. The bottom-most turtle may have its head in the
clouds, but its feet rest firmly on the ground.

The exact plane where the symbolic meets the literal is difficult to identify
definitively. At some imperceptible point software disappears into hardware.
Such ambiguity between hardware and software leads to some controversy in the
critical literature, as evidenced by Lev Manovich's playful response to
Kittler's "there is no software" argument. If I understand it correctly,
Kittler's short but often cited essay picks up the thread of Kittler's earlier
work to posit what he calls a "postmodern writing scene." "We do not write
anymore," writes Kittler: "human-made writing passes through microscopically
written inscriptions which, in contrast to all historical writing tools, are
able to read and write by themselves" [@kittler_there_1995]. According to this
schema, Kittler sees the paper-bound design blueprints of the first integrated
microprocessor as the last "real" piece of writing. Everything written after
that point is hardware (because software is hardware at that "microscopic"
level).

Manovich inverts Kittler's argument into "there is only software," by which he
means that in a pragmatic sense, the affordances of a given medium are
determined by software. A printed page begins to differ from its computed
analogy only when readers are able to effect something on the screen that they
could not on paper. To this end, Manovich encourages his readers to become
active developers of software, rather than its passive consumers
[@manovich_there_2011, 274]. In that, Manovich reasserts the possibility of
writing in the silicon age. Kittler (who passed in 2011) could perhaps object
to that line of reasoning in maintaining that chip architecture (the last
written work, according to him) still determines, as foundation, all higher
levels of textuality "floating" above the silicon bedrock. And no amount of
learning to code would give an ordinary subject the resources required to write
in silicon---a process so advanced and expensive as to be limited to a handful
of international chip manufacturers. In opening a series of nested black boxes,
the post-silicon writer hits the impenetrable casket of chip architecture. Few
of today's engineer-writers are able to work on such deeply-embedded hardware
level.

Before we ourselves get lost in the liminal space between matter and idea, let
us recover a measure of oddity found in the now ubiquitous operation of Turing
machines. Remember that Turing's original description of the Turing machine
derived from a legacy of thought experimentation. Turing does not begin to
build actual machines until his move to Princeton in 1936. A universal Turing
machine comes to life initially as an idea that can take on the structure of
other ideas expressed symbolically. And though Turing describes his machine in
the language of mathematics (where his most significant contribution lies), his
description also contains the bare minimum of a mechanical device. No matter
how symbolic a Turing machine aspires to be, no matter how ascendant to the
realm of the ideal, it remains rooted in the mechanics of reading, writing, and
interpretation.

So far, we too have confronted the literary device only as an idea: imagined
first in the methodological contexts of formalist literary analysis and then as
a thought experiment about generalized symbolic manipulation. But from a
strictly materialist point of view, ideas cannot exist without some physical
underpinnings. Forced to encounter the universal Turing machine *as a
mechanism*, the media historian will find that it borrows from a number of
extant designs, which, together and incrementally, give the UTM its physical
form.

A media history of the Turing machine as device differs from its intellectual
history as symbolic, mathematical abstraction in interesting and instructive
ways.[^ln1-turing] Bracketing for the moment the mathematical and cognitive
implications of Turing's work, I want to approach the Turing machine from the
perspective of a book historian and a media scholar. If the Turing machine is
to be taken at face value, not as an algorithm, but as an instrument, what kind
of a machine would it be? What are its antecedents?

Most of the minimal physical requirements to build a universal Turing machine
were within reach in the 1930s, at the time Turing authored his influential
paper. In practice, his proposal would require first, an apparatus capable of
"scanning" and "erasing" a "finite number of symbols." Second, we would need
what Turing calls "one-dimensional paper," divided into discrete squares "like
a child's arithmetic book" [@turing_computable_1937, 249].[^ln1-infinite]
Furthermore, we would need some sort of a mechanism to advance tape through the
machine, or, alternatively, to propel the scanning mechanism along the length
of the tape. Having assembled these elements, our creation would look roughly
like a cross between a telegraph, a film projector, and a
typewriter.[^ln1-davey]

Were we to patent the Turing machine in the United States, at the time of its
conception (1936-37), the above elements would find prior art in mechanisms
such as the "Numeral adding or subtracting attachment for type-writing
machines" [@daugherty_numeral_1894], "Combined Type-writing and Computing
Machine" [@degener_combined_1911], "Computing Attachment for Typewriters"
[@wright_computing_1914], "Computing Mechanism" [@wright_computing_1915], and
"Combined Type-writing and Adding Machine" [@ellis_combined_1914] among others.
All of these machines contain some combination of a reading and writing "head,"
storage tape, and movement mechanism.

By the end of the nineteenth century a number of lesser contraptions anticipate
the functional elements of Turing's machine. And by 1936, when Turing publishes
his paper on computable numbers, these inventions not only anticipate the
modern computer, but are brought to mass market in the widespread manufacture
of computing scales, dial recorders, electric tabulating machines, and
computing typewriters made by companies like Underwood Computing Machine,
Electromatic, and International Business Machines (IBM). Rather than a single
eureka moment, the invention of the universal machine should therefore be
viewed as a gradual historical process that culminates in Turing's universal
(and minimally viable) specifications.

A number of inventions at the end of the nineteenth century pertain
specifically to "circuit-controlling devices controlled by a traveling
perforated strip or tape" [@cuttriss_telegraphy_1893]. Prior to perforated
tape, the transmission of messages by telegraph required the presence of a
skilled operator, able to transcribe messages from text to Morse code, and into
the physical motion of a lever-operated circuit. In the operation of early
telegraphy, the human operator acted as a mute interpreter between text and
telegraph. The transcription of text into signal, and back onto paper, required
the real-time presence of human encoders and decoders.

The perforated tape decoupled the human from the machine. In US1187035 (1916)
on "Telegraphy", Albert and Ralph Bumstead explain: "the object of our
invention is to provide a system of telegraphy which does not require skilled
operators for the transmission and reception of messages"
[@bumstead_telegraphy_1916]. Instead, the message was transcribed into
perforation via mechanical means and then fed into the mechanism. The tape
mechanics of the typewriter could then be coupled with the electrics of the
telegraph, with perforated tape acting as a mediator between the two "worlds"
of mechanics and electricity.

A number of contraptions emerged at the time with the aim of transfiguring the
mechanical action of the typewriter into perforation, and, consequently,
perforation into script, completing the circuit between automated "encoding"
and "decoding." As one machine converted human input into mechanical states,
and into signal, another machine converted signals into mechanical states and
thereon into human-legible messages.

A multitude of inventions capitalized on the control capabilities of removable
storage media by the beginning of the of the twentieth century. These included
machines for tape-controlled telegraphic transmission
[@wheatstone_improvement_1874; @murray_tape-controlled_1905;
@bumstead_telegraphy_1916], tape-controlled printing [@creed_printing_1911],
printing telegraphs [@hallden_printing-telegraph_1929], and remote broadcast
programming devices for radio and television content [@vriendt_program_1934;
@brown_automatic_1936; @brown_selective_1936]. With the invention of punch
cards and perforated tape (also used in textile looms, as early as 1725), a
message meant for another human became also a physical medium---bumps and
holes---used to animate the mechanical movement of the transmission apparatus.

For example, of the 33 asserted claims in the Bumstead brothers' "Telegraphy"
patent, the first 13 relate to the "transmission of intelligence,"

> [...] adapted to initiate a succession of electrical impulses all of which
> have a character representing significance, a receiver adapted to detect
> variations in time intervals elapsing between successive impulses, a
> plurality of interpreting relays selectively actuated by said receiver, and a
> printed mechanism responsive for the combined action
> [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12-13].

What begins as a description of a mechanism for information transmittal, ends
with a claim about hermeneutics of control. Starting with clause 14, the
brothers begin to describe "a telegraph system" capable of "transmitting
impulses" at varying time intervals. In the language of the patent, the length
of the time interval "represents significance," involving an automated receiver
responsible for "distributing, interpreting, and recording." The printing
mechanism is further "arranged to print the interpretation of the signals which
is made by the interpreting relays" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 6]. The
interpreting relays transform time intervals into a "typographical form"
representing "a letter, a figure, or other characters," "in accordance with a
code" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 13]. Initially, the telegraph prints to
"transmit intelligence." But the authors also understand that the varying time
intervals could also signify other information, meant to actuate a variety of
devices.

By the middle of the patent, the brothers describe their telegraph as a general
"controlling medium," which can power everything from typesetting machines to
more general "sunflower switches." "Indeed the detector and the interpreting
relay could be made to actuate a set of sunflower switches for an indicator
without including a printer at all," the authors conclude
[@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12].

Along with hundreds of similar inventions patented around the turn of the
twentieth century, Bumstead brothers describe a mechanism that could function
as a Turing machine with little modification. The automated telegraph, driven
by ticker tape, and connected to a printer contain all the necessary
requirements set out by Turing: a discrete symbolic language, the removable
storage medium, and a device that can alter its internal states based on the
reading and writing of scanned symbols. They are able "read" and "write" and
otherwise manipulate symbolic representation, they ingest tape, and they
convert covert symbol into internal structure. Like the Turing machine, the
Bumstead telegraph is capable of recursion: ultimately, it can produce and
interpret its own control codes. By 1905, Donald Murray, the inventor of the
popular Murray telegraph, could write that "if we disregard the small class of
telegrams that merely express emotions, *the essence of telegraphy is control*
[emphasis mine]." He wrote also that "telegraph systems, therefore, belong not
to the class of producing or distributing, but to the class of controlling
mechanisms" [@murray_setting_1905, 556]. For the automated telegraph, control
code and the message are one. The mechanism interprets some signals as figure
and character and other signals as control code affecting the internal
mechanical configuration of the device. The first type of code holds
"significance" for humans, where the second for the mechanism itself. It is
"transmitting intelligence" in a sense of externalizing machine states and
"interpreting" in the sense of mechanical reconfiguration of internal parts.

When viewed in the context of book history, the universal Turing machine
signifies a consummation of several broad, long-term trends that begin with the
invention of writing itself.  The material history of literary
computing begins with petrified words that endure forever, and ends with word
as an electrical charge: animated, radiant, fluid, and iridescent
[@mcgann_radiant_2001; @bryant_fluid_2002].

To rediscover the book in the guise of a computational literary artifact means
coming to terms with it as a robot---a device for remote machine control. It
entails seeing through to the simulated nature of the electronic text.
Everything that we know to be true of text in print---from the shape of the
letters to the position of text on a page, to characters, words, sentences,
paragraphs, sections, chapters, and manuscripts, to more abstract categories
like poems, novels, plays, and short stories, to authors, styles, narratives,
and discourses, in short to all textual constructs that have their dimensions
in physical space (and that is all of them), the entire burden of literary
theory---must be reconstructed again as a *simulation*.

Furthermore, it means also gaining awareness of other simulations that are
enacted simultaneously through the device. Where a book is a just a book, the
simulated book fulfills other functions. As a universal Turing machine, the
device has the potential to conjure multiple metaphors. The universal machine
is a machine for making all possible metaphors. It can simulate a book, a
telephone, an alarm clock, a calculator, a typewriter, a censor, a surveyor, a
surveillance system, and otherwise an instrument of governance. Its potential
to simulate other machines is unbounded.

Finally, the very metaphysical nature of Turing machines implies the
irreversible admixture of matter, content, and control. When reading a paper
and cloth book, one can definitively isolate a) the physical properties of
paper and cloth from b) the content of the book and from c) the legal and
political elements governing the production of textuality. To wit: tear out the
copyright notice along with the ISBN number, copy the words into a notebook,
and recycle the paper. The literary device, by contrast, ingests both symbolic
representation and control code through the same input stream. Where images of
governance (like trademark and copyright symbols) *signify*, computed text
*embodies*. Computation enacts control in exactly the sense by which
Wittgenstein suggests to insert a layer of "rules" between symbol and
interpretation, the sense by which Turing imagines computation as symbolic
embodiment, and in the sense carried out through a class of devices for remote
control and communication.

If symbols, something used to represent something else, elicit a type of an
illusion, the universal symbolic machine enacts the ultimate illusion. It
creates a phantasmal image of symbolism itself. The history of computing is
thus a history of symbolism in the broadest possible meaning of the word, which
includes lyric poetry and symbolic logic. The difficult truth for the
contemporary reader is that the computational metaphor, embodied on the level
of the device, resists interpretation by conventional means. Metaphors of
computation frame deep structure affecting basic everyday interaction with
computers. As with all metaphors, nothing is what it seems: to "save" a
document, to "copy" it and to "delete" it, to "surf" or to "browse" the
internet, to "run" a program, the softness of software and the hardness of
hardware, to "turn the page," to "bookmark," to "highlight," and ultimately to
"read a book"---these are all metaphors that obscure the underlying material
conditions of symbolic exchange. The metaphors ingratiate themselves to us in
daily use. With time they disappear from view: invisible metaphors of
invisibility.  When habituated, they alienate us from the symbol. A new wave of
estrangement is needed to rouse it from its metaphorical slumber.

In drawing the history of the book as a universal Turing machine, we observe
the evolution of symbolism into its final and totalizing form. By converting
machine states into symbols, the Turing machine represents the ultimate
negation of matter. It subsumes all lesser mechanisms amenable to
computation---which some would say includes brains and universes.[^ln1-brains]
The universal Turing machine has the potential to mediate everywhere, yet,
paradoxically, it's method of "mediation" abstracts from any notion of medium
or intervening substance.

Under the command and control regime of the Turing machine, text loses its
adhesion to the world. Yet it would be a mistake to think of it as wholly
ethereal. The symbol itself, in its rawest form, anchors the Turing machine to
the confines of the physical universe. No matter the transcendental impulse,
the universal Turing machine cannot be abstracted beyond its minimal physical
requirements: "tape," "symbol," "scanned square," "in the machine"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231].[^ln1-inside]

A figure of computation emerges in the dual movement between symbol and
machine: the machine that pushes the symbol towards the ethereal, and the
symbol that pulls the machine back towards earth. This dynamic encapsulates the
bargain at the center of computational media, explored for the duration of the
book. The machine frees symbolic representation from its material confines. The
price of freedom is the very opacity of the material context. Where words etched
in paper or stone constituted a single site for textual activity, the digital
word exists in a simulated environment physically apart from the underlying
material substratum. Freedom reveals itself as a simulation.

The seeming immateriality of digital media entails real-world effects: the
costs of replication plummet, for example. Computational text can be copied
effortlessly, with minimal cost, and with near-perfect fidelity.
Hyper-reproducibility of the sort was unthinkable for most of the twentieth
century. The machine allows for rapid remediation. Lowered costs of copying
further reduce barriers to access and conveyance. Symbols that adhere lightly
to their medium are easy to store and to transport. Witness the rise of
massive, global public knowledge projects like online search engines and
encyclopedias as a direct consequence. Such projects unfold the logic of
immateriality, which moves towards totalizing archives and universal
accessibility.[^ln1-google] When representation appears to weigh nothing, one
imagines a weightless totality of all representation, available immediately and
everywhere. The perceived weightlessness of text has other side-effects as
well. For example, a text that adheres lightly to its medium is also difficult
to contain, making onerous the governance of symbolic representation and
weakening traditional controls like censorship and intellectual property
rights.

Yet, despite the appearances, the sign does not and cannot exist in a vacuum.
Rather, the symbol splits in two: with one half arising visibly, a weightless
and apparent screen simulation, and the other half, opaque, etched into the
hefty and hidden material contingencies of the device. The material substrates
of computational text likewise carry real-world affordances and consequences.
They are first and foremost hidden from view. Drives and tapes reside inside of
black or aluminum boxes. If only because they carry electrical current and have
the potential to catch fire, they are regulated. They contain heavy and rare
metals, often hazardous if touched or ingested. The computational part of the
sign is sealed in miniaturized containers that prevent access and to resist
tempering. These are but some of the realities of computed text. It is text
intertwined with machine internals and control code and it is often
hermeneutically sealed to resist human interpretation.

In the process of textual production, printing and typesetting, it is certain
that my words were mixed with machine language, which in turn changed the
structure of the devices in your lap, in your hand, near to your eye,
embedded, or embodied. I could say that I bear no responsibility for extending
the reach of machine language so close to the reader. But that would be
factually incorrect. The choice of my writing implements and my channels of
communication affect deeply the contexts of interpretation. Such choices, in
aggregate, define the shared ecosystem of knowledge that surrounds us.
Traditional strategies of close reading which limit interpretation to the
parsing of visible content risk missing the concealed machinations of naked
circuit control. It looks like you are reading a book, but this book may
change depending on the readers race, gender, ethnicity, geography, or
political affiliation. Who has agency program the device? Were a book also a
pill or fused with the neural circuitry of the brain, would you know what and
whom you were reading?

engineering and computer science is a common occurrence in North American
universities.

[^ln1-caveat]: The institutional distinctions between software engineering and
computer science often hinge on the extent to which the discipline pays heed to
the physical limitations of computing. As usual the situation on the ground is
much more complicated, and the boundaries between software engineering and
computer science are fast eroding. Still, North American students often have
the choice to major in Computer Science or Software Engineering. It would not
be unusual for the one faculty to be located in the School for Liberal Arts and
Science and the other in the School of Engineering. Consider also the two major
professional organizations: Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). See

@vessey_unified_2005.

[^ln1-notquite]: To what extent a personal computer is a Turing machine is
matter of contention. The Turing machine is a *thought experiment* that
imagines a machine. The PC is a machine emulating the thought experiment. See
@putnam_representation_1988, 121-5; @chalmers_does_1996; @petzold_code:_2000. A
more detailed discussion follows in 1.2.

[^ln1-kant]: Or at least proceeding as if one has agency to structure one's own
experience, despite the overwhelming evidence for determinism.

[^ln1-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
matter, what we regard as computer instructions, and consequently what we
regard as computer programs, is determined by computers available," he writes
[@moor_three_1978, 215]. Nurbay Irmark argues that software is instead a purely
abstract artifact, akin to a musical work [@irmak_software_2012]. See also
@turner_programming_2013; @colburn_software_1999.

[^ln1-turing]: The intellectual history of the Turing machine is well
established, in multiple works on the subject. It follows the Greek Diophantus,
René Descartes, Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell,
Kurt Gödel, Ludwig Wittgenstein [@petzold_annotated_2008;
@herken_universal_1988; @grattan-guinness_development_1981].

[^ln2-shklov]: I rely on the Russian originals throughout, but will cite the
English translations where possible as well.

[^ln1-descartes]: Descartes writes in his 1637 *Discourse on Method*: "If
there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or some
other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they
were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; whereas if there were
any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our
action as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very
certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true
men." Also quoted in @dennett_can_2004, 297.

[^ln1-margin]: The prominence of Turing's voice in the lecture notes could be
attributed to his later prominence.

[^ln1-cope]: See for example @copeland_what_2000 and
@wagner_wittgenstein_2005.

[^ln1-auto]: See for example @heidegger_pathmarks_1998, 57: "For the phenomenon
most worthy of thought and questioning remains the mystery of
language---wherein our entire reflection has to gather itself---above all when
it dawns on us that language is not a work of human beings: language speaks."
See also @blanchot_work_1995, 41.

[^ln1-consensus]: The literature on consensual governance, for example, going
back to Hobbes, Locke, and Mill, often touches on the problem of lapsed
consent. To paraphrase, they ask: What makes whatever compacts made by past
generations still valid today?

[^ln1-timeline]: To give you a sense of the timeline: Turing entered King's
College in 1931 [@hodges_alan_1983, 78]. His paper on computable numbers
appeared in print in 1936. It is likely that the two philosophers met at the
Moral Science Club, where by the 1930s Wittgenstein "monopolized the
discussion," even in the presence of prominent philosophers like George Edward
Moore [@duncan-jones_g._1958, 25]. Turing attended Wittgenstein's lectures on
the foundations of mathematics in 1939. 

[^ln1-anticipate]: As Alonzo Church mentioned in his review of the paper a
year later, Turing's mathematical insight was anticipated by concomitant work
in the field [@church_computable_1937].

[^ln1-platotr]: I translate the passage into literal, if awkward, English to
preserve some of the interesting characteristics of the original Greek. In
particular, note the parallelism between *exōthen* and *endothen*, the
ambiguity of *allotrion*, as something that comes from another, and the subtle
slide between *graphō* (letter, figure, writing) and *tupōn* (type,
impression, trace). I extend my gratitude to Stathis Gourgouris, Simos Zenios,
and Guy Smoot for their help with the Greek translations.

[^ln1-turingcog]: Turing's later work suggests that his use of cognitive
language throughout "On Computable Numbers" was not accidental, and that he
meant it to define sentience more generally [@turing_computing_1950].
