# Chapter 2: Laying Bare the Device (The Modernist Origins of Computational Culture)

"The weakest point in our present day universe is the incapacity of man to
meet the machine, the culture conserve, or the robot, other than through
submission, actual destruction, and social revolution" [@moreno_who_1953,
233]. So wrote the Austrian-American psychiatrist, Jacob L. Moreno between the
years of 1934 and 1953, in his idiosyncratic, sprawling, and now seldom read
volume, *Who Shall Survive?* He is remembered today as a pioneer of group
therapy and an early critic of Freud and socialism. Sociologists have also
recently rediscovered his formative work on network analysis. His books
contain beautiful diagrams, sprouting nodes and edges, with titles like
"Structure of a Cottage Family," "A Handicraft Group," and "The Civilian
Social Atom." Moreno was also a humanist and a philosopher of technology and
culture. In opposition to eugenics, a popular philosophy at the time, his
answer to "Who Shall Survive?" was "everyone" [@moreno_who_1953, 245].

Humanity, according to Moreno, faces two major threats: first embodied in the
aggression from other human beings, and second, in the aggression of robots
or what Moreno alternatively called the "cultural conserve" and the
"zootechnical animal" [@moreno_who_1953, 237]. Robots for Moreno encompass all
devices, social structures, and products of the mind that diminish creativity.
With time, "technical devices" and the "methods in the making of cultural
products" are inherited and "used with less friction." For Moreno, technology
was above all a labor-saving device, creativity being the single most
important kind of labor. When the effort of creativity diminishes
significantly, humans begin to "neglect and abandon the genuine and
outstanding creative process." The robot leads to the extinguishing of "all
the active, living moments," striving towards the "illusion of the finished,
perfected product" [@moreno_who_1953, 233]. This illusion reduces humans to
"machine-addicts," residing in a "jungle of robots" that threatens to
suffocate all spontaneous activity. Through robots, life then becomes a
script.

In the name of comfort, safety, and prolonged life, technocracy disempowers
the very subjects whose lives it claims to preserve. The zootechnical animal
exchanges the human capacity for self-determination for the promised certainty
of a better future. Moreno wrote:

> The eugenic dreamer and the technological dreamer have one idea in common to
substitute and hasten the slow process of nature. Once the creative process is
encapsulated in a book it is *given*; it can be recapitulated eternally by
everybody without the effort of creating anew. Once a machine for a certain
pattern of performance is invented a certain produce can be turned out in
infinite numbers practically without effort [...] Once that miraculous eugenic
formula will be found a human society will be given prefect and smooth at
birth, like a book off a press [@moreno_who_1953, 236].

Similar to king Thamus from Plato's *Phaedrus*, Moreno distrusted rote
mechanization of thought itself. Instrumental and institutional mechanisms
alike fell under suspicion: the plow, the pen, the book, the typewriter, the
gun, the rocket and the atomic bomb, radio and television, central planning,
corporate governance, and legal codex [@moreno_who_1953, 237-44]. Contrary to
my intuitions, this list places both books and bombs at the same level of
analysis. For Moreno, the one resembles the other in that they both embody a
kind of agency detached from its human sources. Once released, both books and
bombs seem to act in the world autonomously; they do not reach their
destination at once; their impact is delayed in time and space. Volition so
detached and animated operates without consensus or comprehension. Splintered
from its source, the robot staggers forth, *golem*-like, through books, laws,
and social institutions.

Near immortal, images of the past proliferate and crowd out the present.
Moreno wrote:

In the aftermath of World War II, Moreno expanded the first edition of his
book to consider the ultimate automaton, the atomic bomb. "Mankind has been
awakened from a dream," he wrote. The atomic bomb gives humanity a glimpse of
its enemy: mindless agents in possession of detached human volition. These
mechanisms compete with living actors for survival. Once in motion,
robots---books and bombs---continue to do their bidding blindly. They survive
and continue to shape the social and the mental worlds to come.

Moreno further wrote:

> The book is a robot par excellence [@moreno_who_1953, 238].

For Moreno, the inertia of past decisions embodied in extant mechanisms
ultimately posed a threat for human survival. In this view, the real
competition for survival happens not between persons, sects, races, or
nations, but between humanity and its automatons. To compete with the robot
humans must expand their capacity for creation. Creative spontaneity is the
one advantage they have over what he called the zootechnical animal. The robot
responds with repetition, leading to indolence. Forces of automatism ease the
burden of creativity, diminishing human capacity for poiesis. Moreno's therapy
practice was therefore based on the principle of creative spontaneity
training, or "psychodrama," aimed at the construction of communities that
acknowledge and preserve a sense of personal agency. As far as I can tell from
the records, the practice involved group improvisation and role-play, in what
Moreno called the "techniques of freedom" [@moreno_who_1953, 8].

Moreno's jarring parallelism reminds us that both books and bombs constitute a
species of autonomous agency, a problem long in the background of Western
liberal thought.[^ln1-consensus] Both print and weaponry embody human volition
displaced in time and space. The projectile acts at a distance; once launched,
it completes its grim mandate even if the command to act is withdrawn.
Technology of the word similarly decouples readers from writers. The book
persists to mean in the absence of its author. Once decoupled, seemingly
autonomous paper agents---books, folders, documents---clutter the social
sphere, continuing to structure human experience in the absence of the
originating accord. Knowledge, in Plato's terms, is replaced with the
simulation or imitation [*homoiōmata*] of knowledge [@plato_phaedrus_1999,
482(250a)].

The above might appear a curious way of putting things, but not unusual in the
larger context of post-Kantian humanism at the turn of the twentieth century.
Moreno's work reflects the influence of Marx's critique of the fetishism of
commodities, a dynamic by which "definite social relation between men" assumes
"the fantastic form of a relation between things" [@marx_capital_1967, 72].
Moreno arrives at a similar conclusion by another logic. In creating some of
the earliest examples of social network graphs, he finds (and objects to) the
presence of things in the position of social actors. His objections to
automatism echo also those of his near contemporaries like Viktor Shklovsky,
Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, and Hannah Arendt.

***

Moreno helps us see the book in a new light. If it was always, as he
suggested, a robot for enacting action at a distance, it is all the more
robotic as a device that draws electricity, an electronic book. When in the
1930s one could view Moreno's rhetoric about books and bombs as a
fanciful---technophobic even---view of literary technology, a century later
his concern appears pressing and prescient. The unintended consequences of
automated and disembodied agency, from artificially intelligent personal
assistants to market trading algorithms, worry contemporary scientists,
legislators, and philosophers. What looks like a book today indeed takes on
the functions of a gun and trigger. Electronic books read on mobile phones,
tablets, and personal computers comprise a part of the same digital framework
that powers drones and aircraft carriers. Today, computers in the service of
the world's largest purveyors of literature are also used by air traffic
control and covert intelligence agencies [@soyata_combat:_2012;
@logicworks_government_2015]. A cellular phone, once a device used solely for
voice telecommunication, is now used ubiquitously both to read books and to
detonate explosives at a distance.

These conditions compel us---historians, philologists, et al.---to reconsider
the cozy relationship we have had with books since the advent of the Gutenberg
press. Simulated text no longer plays by the same rules as print. The
bibliographic illusion veils machine internals. My task in this chapter will
be to illuminate the blueprint of computation within the electronic book. In a
reciprocal movement, I aim also to place the modern computer itself within the
long history of the book and to view it as technique for literary and not just
mathematical symbolism. To achieve these tasks, I will construct a short
prehistory of the literary device, based on materials roughly from the first
half of the twentieth century. I am interested here broadly in the concepts of
device and technique which emerge in the thought of Russian, German, and
English philologists whose work I will cover in the first section of this
chapter. Subsequent sections trace the concomitant emergence of literary
device in another sense, as a thought experiment staged by Ludwig Wittgenstein
and completed by Alan Turing in the 1920s and 1930s. These experiments lead us
to consider a series of fantastical broken reading and writing machines:
machines that define the limits of symbolic thought and ultimately culminate
in a blueprint for a specific mechanism, which lies at the modernist origins
of contemporary computational culture.

## Technique

What kind of a *thing* is a literary *device*? The formalist concept of a
device is in part an artifact of an unfortunate translation from the Russian
*priem*. The word would be better translated as "technique," in the sense of
"method," "approach," or "procedure." Device contains these meanings as well,
but in modern usage, it often carries a more concrete connotation, as an
"object, machine, or piece of equipment that has been made for a special
purpose" [@_device_2016]. "Laying bare the device," for Viktor Shklovsky, the
Russian formalist critic who coined the phrase at the turn of the twentieth
century, meant making explicit the implied mechanisms of literary trope,
particularly in cases where such tropes turn "stale," "automatic," and
"naturalized," that is, bereft of their original poetic and evocative
power.[^ln2-shklov]

Vladimir Nabokov, a writer conspicuously aware of his literary-theoretical
heritage, used the formal technique of "laying bare the device" often and with
relentless clinical precision. In the short story "A Guide to Berlin," to
which D. Barton Johnson attributes our first glimpse at Nabokov's "mature
virtuoso style," Nabokov wrote:

> In front of the house where I live, a gigantic black pipe lies along the
outer edge of the sidewalk. A couple of feet away, in the same file, lies
another, then a third and a fourth---the street's iron entrails, still idle,
not yet lowered into the ground, deep under the asphalt. For the first few
days after they were unloaded, with a hollow clanging, from trucks, little
boys would run on them, up and down, and crawl on all fours through those
round tunnels, but a week later nobody was playing anymore and thick snow was
falling instead; and now when, cautiously probing the treacherous glaze of the
sidewalk with my thick rubber-heeled stick, I go out in the flat gray light of
the morning, an even stripe of fresh snow stretches along the upper side of
each black pipe [...] Today someone wrote "Otto" with his finger on the strip
of virgin snow, and I thought how beautifully that name, with its two soft o's
flanking the pair of gentle consonants suited the silent layer of snow upon
that pipe with its two orifices and its tacit tunnel [@nabokov_guide_1976, 27;
@johnson_guide_1979, 354].

This tightly wound vignette takes the formalist programmatic concern with
"laying bare the device" to its logical conclusion. The pipes can be read as a
metaphor for a literary device. Usually found beneath the street, they now sit
idle and visible above the surface. Even when exposed, the device fails to
captivate for long. Disused, it once again passes out of sight, covered in
snow. Concerned with surfaces, the narrator "probes the glaze" of the street
and finds a palindrome written in snow. The inscription "OTTO" not only
resembles the pipes visually, but is in itself a surface-revealing inscription
that makes the pipes visible again. Although the metaphoric pipe does not
reach beyond the page, the mimetic surface inscription draws attention to the
word's visual shape and acoustics. It invites readers to perform the symmetry
of its consonance as they pronounce the word. The round vowels and the
interrupting obstruents of "OTTO" contort the body in accordance with the
sound image: reverse mimesis, the body as sound pipe. The moment of corporeal
reenactment transcends the representational and paper-bound confines of the
medium. The performance makes the "making of the literary technique obvious,"
obvious. Nabokov exposes the metaphor implicit in the idea of "laying bare the
device" itself. In this lies the prevalent characteristic of Nabokov's mature
work, which often seeks to transcend the diegetic, fictional world through
sheer recursion of literary technique, where each successive turn of
abstraction pushes the buried symbol closer to the reader.

Despite the emphasis on laying bare the device, formalist poetics (both in art
and in scholarship) fell short of producing an explicit theory of technique.
In this section, I will attempt to reconstruct the notion of technique through
the thought of three major literary theorists of the interwar period: Viktor
Shklovsky, Percy Lubbock, and Mikhail Bakhtin. I do not mean to suggest that
the group amounts to a coherent school of thought. Rather, I am interested in
observing the development of technique as a concept in parallel traditions at
a formative time in the history of literary technology. I am consequently
going to do something unusual in this chapter, namely juxtapose relevant
patches of literary theory and material culture, which converge on a
mechanistic view of reading, writing, and interpretation. These observations
evidence fragments of a larger history. The reader should not mistake them for
a complete canvas. I arrange them in this way to provoke a response and to
find curious early intersections between disparate intellectual
traditions---literary theory, philosophy, and electrical engineering---which
intertwine to form the fabric of contemporary computational culture.

Viewed in the context of technological development, the emergence of technique
as a critical category reflects the broader concerns of the machine age. The
notion of *technology* itself does not fully find its place in the critical
literature until the 1950-1970s, judging by the rash of titles like like
Martin Heidegger's *Die Frage nach der Technik* (1954), Jacques Ellul's *La
technique ou l'enjeu du siècle* (1954), Lynn White's *Medieval Technology and
Social Change* (1966), and Viktor Fekiss's *The Technological Man* (1969),
among many similar volumes appearing in the period. Calling for the
institution of a new field in 1959, the editors of the inaugural issue of the
journal *Technology and Culture* would write about the "neglect of study of
technology" amidst a body of extant work that has "scarcely constituted" a
systematic scholarly discipline [@kranzberg_at_1959]. "*Technology* is a word
whose time has come," Langdon Winner would still write in 1978 in his
influential *Autonomous Technology* [@winner_autonomous_1978, 4]. Before
technology, there was technique.

Google Books ngram corpus

Seen in this light, the pre-WWII concern with literary technique anticipates
the post-war turn towards technology as a field of cultural analysis. The
formalist period in literary theory signalled a turn away from history and
philosophy of literature towards the mechanics of literary production. The
technical turn entailed a mechanistic understanding of language, by which
linguistic phenomena was viewed as a system of moving parts, whose
relationship to one another was determined by discoverable laws. The turn to
technique also meant that the mechanisms of meaning production, on the sides
of both authorship and apprehension, were made accessible to a mass audience.
The Russian formalists in particular understood their task as one of radical
democratization of the literary sphere. High literature that was once the
purview of the select few could now belong to the proletariat at large. This
meant that the reading and writing of literature could be distilled into
reproducible rules---technique over art---to be learned and shared widely.

Aside from its political implications, the mechanization of language gains
further significance in its instrumental context. As we shall see in the later
chapters, developments in aesthetic theory I describe here followed a period
of rapid innovation in the technologies of the word. The rise of formalist and
consequently structuralist thought---along with philosophy's linguistic turn
that saw language as a system of rule-based games---parallels the rise of
rule-based programmable media: punch cards, magnetic drums, and ticker tape.
That is not to say that thought and technology stand in a reductive causal
relationship to one another. Rather, they form a feedback loop, in which
instruments, practices, and explanatory models evolve through mutual
reciprocation. My understanding of the literary device in both of its
senses---as technique and device---is therefore motivated by more than mere
linguistic ambiguity contained in the meaning of the word *device*. Locating
the literary-theoretical construct of the device within its technological
context allows us to witness the contemporaneous evolution and the mutual
interdependence between art, engineering, and philosophy. The origins of
computer science and literary formalism can be traced back to shared
theoretical assumptions and technological contingencies coming to the fore of
telecommunications in the first few decades of the twentieth century.

It is at this time that the formalist concept of technique begins to abstract
the idea of literary production from its affective, intimate, and
irreproducible contexts. The emphasis on craft over art implies primarily a
change in the artist's relationship to labor. Walter Benjamin had this view in
mind when he wrote decades later about the work of art that can no longer be
thought of as a "rigid, isolated object." Rather, "it must be inserted into
the context of living social relations," and therefore, into the context
determined by its relation to literary production [@benjamin_author_1983, 87].
Technique, for Benjamin, made literary products "accessible" to materialist
analysis [@benjamin_author_1983, 87]. Where the artistic genius is unique,
craft carries with it a model of inheritance. Where genius is born, technique
is shared. Where the artist labors alone, the craftsman learns a trade in a
workshop, as part of a collective.

In a more general sense, I view the turn to technique as a rejection of the
aesthetics of Romanticism: like those of Schopenhauer for example, who
emphasised individual creative genius reaching "beyond the objects which
actually present themselves" towards the transcendent ideal
[@schopenhauer_world_1906, 249 and 217-346]. Formalism dispelled the myth of
the lone genius creator, instead orienting the artist towards discovery
through handicraft. In his "Art as Device," Shklovsky wrote:

> The work of poetic schools amounts to the aggregation and the discovery of
> new devices/techniques [*priem*] for the arrangement and the processing of
> linguistic material, and, in particular, more so with the rearrangement of
> figure [*obraz*] rather than with its creation" [@shklovksy_poetika_1919,
> 102].

Influenced by the work of Herbert Spencer, the formalists imagined language to
comprise a kind of a natural physics-based system, which tended towards the
conservation of energy [@shklovksy_poetika_1919, 105]. In his influential 1852
essay on the *The Philosophy of Style*, Spencer wrote about ordinary ways of
speaking where "words are not pronounced fully," and where "the mind barely
perceives the initial sounds of each word" [@spencer_philosophy_1892]. The
ideal writer according to Spencer also strove to minimize the reader's mental
exertion, following the law of what he called the "economy of composition:" to
say as much as possible in the most concise and direct way. Poetry for Spencer
was exemplary in this regard, in that it was able to adopt those habituated
"symbols of thought" and "those methods of using them" that have proven
themselves to be most effective through continuous use
[@spencer_philosophy_1892]. Spencer's ideal of literature was therefore of the
most thrifty, economical kind.

Shklovsky agreed with Spencer about the dynamics of everyday language, but not
poetry. Poetry's did not facilitate communication, he argued, but disrupt it.
Poets "arranged and processed" habituated material with the view of
"resurrecting" the vitality of the word lost to everyday habituation
[@shklovsky_voskreshenie_1914]. Estrangement or the "de-programming" of
received trope constituted for Shklovsky the primary technique of aesthetic
discourse. Poetic estrangement counterbalances the work of prosaic
habituation, by which shorthand cliché replaces complex things and ideas.
Thus, where everyday language follows the laws of conservation of energy,
poetic language expands energy to belabor, make language difficult again
[*zatrudnenie*], and prolong apprehension [*vospriiatie*]. If for Spencer
language was a labor-saving device, for Shklovsky poetry was labor-intensive.

Any innovation in the linguistic sphere was, in the formalist view, bound to
follow a cycle of habituation and renewal. With time, a literary device
capable of arresting apprehension itself became normalized and in need of
renewal. Consequently, the evolution of aesthetic periods followed a course of
arbitrary differentiation, in what Jean Moréas (a symbolist poet and art
critic important for the history of formalism) called a "cyclical evolution"
[*évolution cyclique*], by which the dominant device in one period became a
cliché in the next. Art depletes itself, "from copy to copy, from imitation to
imitation." What seems fresh today "dries up and shrivels," and what seemed
new and spontaneous becomes a hackneyed commonplace [@moreas_symbolisme_1886].
Technique in that sense was seen by the formalists as a kind of information
processing at the meta-linguistic, social level. The mechanics of "arrangement
and the rearrangement of figure" produce new meaning within habituated
contexts, motivating the engine of literary development.

In the 1920s, reflecting critically on Shklovsky's "materialist aesthetics"
Mikhail Bakhtin would write that the formal model of aesthetic genre formation
was capable only of establishing a "chronological table of variance in the
evolution of technical devices," because "in isolation technique cannot have a
history" [@bakhtin_k_2003, 270-1]. The formalist model of literary development
seemed to the more teleologically oriented critic meandering and meaningless.
Bakhtin was also less inclined towards materialism than the formalists. He
was, for example, careful not to reduce technique to questions of "material
arrangement" alone. He wrote, "I am quite ready to join in the sentiment that
'in art technique is everything,' provided we understand that the aesthetic
object cannot exist independent of the artistic work." For Bakhtin, the work
existed neither in the mind nor in the arrangement of matter alone
[@bakhtin_k_2003, 308-10]. Any immanent volume of text, an edition of
Shakespeare's *Hamlet* for example, could not, for Bakhtin, exhaust the
possibility of *Hamlet* as a transcendent work of art. Neither could the work
be reduced its pure idea, because any notion of *Hamlet* as an idea must rest
on firm material foundations---the textual witness---be it an original folio
or critical edition. Similarly, Bakhtin was unwilling to reduce the notion of
technique to the mere manipulation of physical form, independent of the
aesthetic idea-object. "In art, technique is not mechanistic," he wrote.
Rather, "technique animates and motivates the aesthetic object at every point"
[@bakhtin_k_2003, 310]. But what what exactly did he mean by technique?

For Bakhtin, technique was that force which at any point of a text was capable
of translating ideas into things and things into ideas, where the meaning of
the word (sentence, passage, novel) could materialize into a specific
arrangement of paper and ink and the other way around. Within the ontological
indeterminacy of art which exists simultaneously as an object and idea,
Bakhtin approximated the following formula: "the audience is equivalent to the
creator, minus technique." The audience experiences the creative process of
the making of the work of art, though without an understanding of the craft
involved. Alternatively, the author "equals the audience plus technique"
[@bakhtin_k_2003, 373-4]. Technique was, in other words, a "method of
processing content through material" [@bakhtin_k_2003, 249]. Again we return
to the notion of labor or procedure, which transforms raw material into a work
of art, no longer an object limited by its physical dimensions. In this light,
the goal of poetics---the study of that transformation---became, in Bakhtin's
words, the analysis of the "technical apparatus of aesthetic creation:" the
movement between works and objects of art and back from things to ideas
[@bakhtin_k_2003, 275].

Even as formalism flirted with the idea of a materialist poetics, the "matter"
of formal analysis was limited to the abstract notion of language, which, as
is the case with any abstraction, can exist only in a categorical sense: in a
way that all whales are mammals, for example. In that sense, mammals are not a
thing. The category of language similarly comprises a theoretical aggregate of
specific vernaculars, argots, and dialects. In giving names to literary
phenomena---genres and periods, for example---the literary critic moves from
material specifics to categorical abstractions. In this light, we can view
Nabokov's recursive meta-poetics as a response counter to the critic's method
of induction. His prose attempts to convert ideas into things, where pipes and
surface inscriptions protrude through the diegetic limits of the fictional
world. Nabokov aims to convert categories back into things.

On the way of becoming a thing, the word necessarily encounters the physical
boundaries of its medium. Whatever the limits of a fictional world, they are
firmly constrained by the book's covers. Nabokov's prose often reveals the
page to be the outer-most literary device containing all other literary
devices. The surface of the page is where the literary device in its
linguistic sense meets the literary device in its material, where the
fictional world bumps against the real. Recall, for example the conclusion of
Nabokov 1936 *Invitation to a Beheading*, which ends with the imagined
dissolution of the diegetic boundaries in a glimpse of the material reality
"on the other side" of the page:

> Everything was falling. A spinning wind was picking up and whirling: dust,
> rags, chips of painted wood, bits of gilded plaster, pasteboard bricks,
> posters; an arid gloom fleeted; and amidst the dust, and the falling things,
> and the flapping scenery, Cincinnatus made his way in that direction where,
> to judge by the voices, stood beings akin to him [@nabokov_invitation_1959,
176].

In this way, formal literary technique gestures towards the real, arresting
the illusion of mimesis and exposing the incapacity of the literary world to
assume physical form. Material properties of the book place a hard constraint
on its ideational content. Nabokov liked to draw attention to that boundary
throughout his career, creating meta-literary characters that struggle to
escape the page.

The difficulty of pinpointing the area of transition between thoughts and
objects leads to the critic's perpetual inability to capture the material
contexts of literary production. Pen and paper are known to the writer only.
By the time of consumption, they are hidden from view. Echoing his Soviet
colleagues in his influential *The Craft of Fiction*, the English critic Percy
Lubbock, himself a formalist of sorts, would write:

> To grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of the book, to hold it fast, to
> turn it over and to survey it at leisure---that is the effort of a critic of
> books, and it is perpetually defeated [...] Nothing, no power, will keep the
> book steady and motionless before us so that we may have time to examine its
> shape and design [@lubbock_craft_1921, 1].

Note the use of the object-oriented vocabulary in the above passage in a way
that does not quite refer to objects. When Lubbock uses words like "form,"
"book," "shape," and "design" or when he refers to grasping, holding, and
keeping the book motionless, he refers to these concepts metaphorically as in
"holding," "grasping," and "keeping" the thing before the mind's eye. The book
continually escapes the reader's mental, not physical, grasp. Nor do his
books, forms, shapes, and designs refer to the outward, material aspects of
the literary artifact. These are again mental constructions, not material.

Our unfamiliarity with what Lubbock calls the novel's "technical aspects"
thereby hampers our ability to understand how it comes to present itself to
the mind in its entirety [@lubbock_craft_1921, 272]. The viewer grasps other
more plastic art forms like sculpture or painting whole and at
once.[ln2-herder] These exist at a time and place limited to their physical
dimensions. Narratives unfold in time, by contrast. To perceive a book, to
read a novel, critically, we must abstract from the physical object and extend
it in working memory, past immediate perception. Meaning-making of the sort
involves the assemblage of linguistic minutiae to construct a synthetic
literary whole. Lubbock writes that the "real heart and substance of the book
[...] stands out more clearly for the obscurity into which the less essential
parts of it subside" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 4]. To read in this mode is
precisely to deny the book its materiality. When reading for pleasure, lay
readers lose themselves in the elements of narrative immediately available for
observation. To read the novel for pleasure for Lubbock is to "forget, if we
can, that the book is an object of art. [@lubbock_craft_1921, 6]" By object of
art he means the transcendent idea of the novel as opposed to the immanent
work itself. To "objectify the elements" of the novel that "strike us more
keenly," as Lubbock phrases it, therefore means for him quite the opposite of
what is usually meant by objectification. The complete mental idea of the
novel congeals only at the conclusion of reading. Lubbock writes: "Far from
losing ourselves in the world of the novel, we must hold it away from us, see
it all in detachment, and use the whole of it to make the image we seek, the
book itself" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 6]. But to hold away means actually to
internalize it completely. And by "book" he means the idea of a novel, not at
all the thing itself. Thus to read critically is, paradoxically, also to
arrest the coming-into-being of the work. The difficulty of materialist
poetics reflects in the language that continually conflates mental and
physical constructs.

[^ln2-herder]: Lubbock collapses somewhat the difference between painting and
sculpture. See for example @herder_sculpture_2002.

Critical reading in Lubbock's sense entails an account of the transformation
from things to ideas: from words and sentences to stories, novels, and verse.
Echoing Boris Eichenbaum in "How *The Overcoat* is Made," Lubbock is
interested in mechanics of literary craft---in how the thing is made. He
promises to view a "handful of familiar novels [...] with some particularity,"
but without judgement or critique. "How they are made is the only question I
ask," he writes [@shklovksy_poetika_1919; @lubbock_craft_1921, 12 & 28;
@eichenbaum_how_1995]. Since the author of the book was a "craftsman" it is
therefore the critic's role to "overtake him at his work and see how the book
was made," Lubbock repeats elsewhere [@lubbock_craft_1921, 274]. His usage of
object-oriented vocabulary---his "parts," "forms," "shapes," "proportions,"
and "designs"---nevertheless refers to constructs mental and ideational, just
as it was for Shklovsky or Eichenbaum. "The book vanishes as we lay our hands
on it," Lubbock writes [@lubbock_craft_1921, 273]. Critics must chose to see
either the trees or the forest. As the totality of the work comes into view,
the technical details of craft---and therefore the book itself---disappear.
Conversely, when viewed up close, the technical particulates obscure sight of
the work as a whole.

*The Craft of Fiction* ends on an ambivalent note.  Lubbock senses the
inadequacy of his materialism: "if only there was one single tangible and
measurable fact about the book," he writes. If only it could be "weighed like
a statue" or "measured like a picture, it would be a support in the world of
shadows [@lubbock_craft_1921, 273-4].

I want to end the section here, with the momentary failure of materialist
poetics, to pick up another concomitant thread, one that will take us through
some of the same concerns about the nature of symbolic representation and its
relationship to the physical world. My aim in this disruption is to disconnect
the history of modern computing from its expected contexts of calculating
machinery and to join it with literary theory, where as we will see, it also
finds a measure of congruity. I do so in the absence of direct evidence for an
explicit intellectual connection.[^ln2-moaran] My goal is not to prove that
such a linkage exists, but rather to irreparably entwine nominally discordant
intellectual and material genealogies in a way that sheds light on our modern
predicament, where books and guided missiles indeed share the same semiotic
infrastructures. Along with critics of contemporary computational culture like
Bernard Harcourt and Frank Pasquale I would like to ask, How did we get here
[@pasquale_black_2015; @harcourt_exposed:_2015]? The thought of Ludwig
Wittgenstein and his student Alan Turing reveals, along with a number of
broken reading and writing machines, a possible answer to the quandary of
materialist poetics, posed in the liminal space between thought and thing.

## Thought Experiment I

Modern computers---and by extension the electronic book---harken back to a
cluster of related thought experiments prevalent in the philosophy of Ludwig
Wittgenstein and subsequently Alan Turing, his long-time student and
colleague. The story of Turing machines has been told before in many guises,
but never with an eye towards literary machines that nevertheless occupy a
central place in the early development of modern computing. To confront the
computer as a literary device one must first understand its peculiar
relationship to universal Turing machines. I would like to frame the
discussion by drawing two further as yet unexplored historical genealogies
that lead to Turing's seminal essay on computable numbers: the first
intellectual, stemming back to his tutelage under Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the
second material, highlighting the physical similarities between Turing's
design and a number of concomitant developments in printing and communication.
To read Turing and Wittgenstein together is to recover a legacy of humanities
computing that often gets overlooked in the history of computer science and
software engineering. The literary perspective is important because it allows
us to see the computer in a new light: more than a byproduct of
quantification, a metaphor machine. Turing machines should interest literary
scholars because they embody a minimally viable model for generalized symbolic
manipulation: reading and writing. Poetics should interest electrical and
software engineers for the same reason, because it grounds computation in the
long history of the word. Turing's thought experiments were meant to solve a
mathematical problem, but their pedigree lies also in the fields of philology
and hermeneutics, the study of textual meaning-making and interpretation.

In his seminal 1936 paper on computable numbers, Alan Turing, then a student
at King's College, proposed a peculiar thought experiment to appear on the
pages of a mathematical journal. The experiment addressed a problem in the
field of elementary number theory [@church_computable_1937]. His solution
involved more than a formula. Instead, he imagined a machine that would in
some real sense take the place of the calculation. Ultimately, Turing
described a device that was meant to embody the symbol: it transformed
external abstractions into physical states, internal to the device. In doing
so, this imagined machine was designed to breach the boundary between idea and
matter. It was exactly an instrument for transforming thoughts into shapes. In
that sense, Turing's hypothetical machine represents a advancement in the
development of a long-standing thought experiment concerning the nature of
human understanding and the beginning of a new, machine-assisted philological
practice.

The question of "automated" philology echoes through the canon of Western
philosophic tradition. What does it mean to read and to understand something?
Is it enough to repeat the words of another, as Phaedrus does in response to
Socrates? Could a student be said to possess reason if he was merely parroting
thoughts and not really thinking on his own? Would we say the same thing of an
animal or a machine? The question was posed also by Descartes who wrote that
it would not be sufficient for the "reasoned soul" to be "lodged in the human
body like a pilot of a ship, except perhaps to move its members," but that
intelligence must be "more closely joined and united with the body to produce
true feelings and appetites." Magpies and parrots can appear to speak,
Descartes writes, but can they show us that they understand
[@descartes_discourse_1996]? And what would that "showing" entail?

<!-- ![Kircher's *Arca Musurgicae*, the musical composition box, 1650
[@kircher_musurgia_1999, 184].](images/music-box.jpg) -->

Recall also the experiments with combinatorial poetics of the 17th century
German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher, the inventor of *Arca Musurgicae*, a
music composition device, by which a composer not versed in music would
combine predetermined musical phrases written on wooden planks to compose a
score. In correspondence with Kircher, the German Baroque poet Quirinus
Kuhlman argued that using such an instrument to compose music or poetry would
amount to "*sed versûs, non poëma* [mere versification, not poetry]." Would we
call a naive child using such a contraption a composer or a poet, he asked?
And answered:

> *Sed lusus est ingeniosus, Ingeniose Kirchere, non methodus, prima fronte
> aliquid promittens, in recessu nihil solvens. Sine cista enim puer nihil
> potest respondere, & in cista nihil praeter verba intelligit; tot profert,
> quot audit, sine intellectu...*

> But [the poetry box] is just an ingenious game, ingenious Kircher, not a
> method, promising something on the surface, but solving nothing deep down.
> For without the box the boy can answer nothing, and with the box he
> understands nothing but words. He produces whatever he hears, without
> understanding, like a parrot [@gillespie_primal_1978, 32].

The child cannot create without mechanical assistance. Like the parrots of
Plato, Kuhlman, and Descartes it mimics creation on the surface. Nothing in
the mind of an automaton corresponds to the outward appearance of thought. The
child composes poetry without thinking---that is without the appropriate deep
structure that should accompany proper poiesis. If technique alone is to guide
the creation of poetry, in a way that was suggested by the formalists, would
purely formal creation be recognized by us as art, or thought, or language
even?

The philosopher John Searle would later pose a similar question in his famous
Chinese Room thought experiment [@searle_minds_1980]. Can a contraption be
said to "speak" a language if inside it contains only a dictionary for looking
up the correct answers to any given query? A man inside the room sorts the
answers blindly. He does not understand the language, yet the contraption
appears to respond properly. Is it enough to appear to understand, in other
words, or should we say that understanding must involve some other appropriate
mechanism, turned inward? Searle argued that his room, a kind of a robot for
automated responses in a foreign language, could not be properly said to speak
a language in the way a fluent speaker can. For Searle and other so-called
"internalists," the external signs of whatever is meant by "speaking" and
"understanding" must correspond to some appropriate internal mental states
[@searle_minds_1980]. Plato, Descartes, Kuhlman, and Searle all pose a version
of the same thought experiment, which aims to draw a line between the surface
appearance of knowledge and an idea of deep, structural understanding opposed
to mere functionalism. Reading and writing should, these thinkers intuit,
leave something behind. A text must be somehow "joined and united" with the
body, to paraphrase Descartes. For understanding to happen words must continue
to produce meaning independent of the original inscription. Internalists like
Searle hold that the inscription and the mental state should also achieve a
measure of structural accordance. Functional, outward appearances are not
enough.

Recall the famous *pharmakon* passage from Plato's *Phaedrus*, which explores
the relationship between writing and its impression on the mind. At the
conclusion of the dialog, King Thamus objects to the technology [*ta tekhnēs*]
of the written word, as he believes it will foster forgetfulness in the people
who use it. Plato writes: "Their faith in extrinsic writing [*graphō
exōthen*], by means of foreign impressions [*allotrion tupōn*] will diminish
their intrinsic [*endothen autous*] capacity to remember"
[@plato_euthyphro._1999].[^ln1-platotr] Plato thus contrasts the exterior
figure of the inscription with memory, an intrinsic cognitive ability. The
Greek *tupōn*, related to the English "type," literally means an impression.
In this case it is also "foreign" or "othered" [*allotrion*]. It comes from
without. Like Moreno after him, Thamus finds thought externalized through
typography problematic. True memory and thought for them both must come from
within. For this reason, Socrates asks the young man to stop reciting the
speech by heart in the beginning of the dialog. He wants Phaedrus to think for
himself and not to merely regurgitate the thought of another--- to stop being,
in other words, a mere parrot or automaton. To truly understand something and
to make a show of their comprehension, readers must do more than read: they
must internalize.  Much can go wrong in that process, but we expect for
reading to ultimately leave an appropriate impression [*tupōn*] on the
reader's mind. For understanding to take place, writing must produce "true,"
in the words of Descartes, feelings and appetites. But what is true,
appropriate, or proper? What impressions does type leave on the soul? What
does it take to internalize or ingest an inscription properly?---these are the
profound mysteries always present even in the most mundane acts of reading and
writing.

## Thought Experiment II

I propose now to view Turing's machine first within the broader tradition of
questioning the correspondence between outward signs of thought and its inward
structure, and second as a specific response to a series of thought
experiments proposed by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the 1930s at Cambridge, where
Turing studied in his early career and later taught.[^ln1-timeline]

Wittgenstein broached the problem of reading machines and comprehension
initially in his *Blue and Brown Books* along with *Philosophical Grammar*
(all compiled in the early 1930s), then in his lectures and remarks on the
foundations of psychology and mathematics from the late 1930s, and finally in
*Philosophical Investigations*, written between 1945 and 1949. The earliest of
these documents, *The Blue Book*, begins with a question of interpretation.
"What is a meaning of a word?" Wittgenstein asks. And from the start, he
cautions his students against choosing the easy answer, which holds that
meaning resides in the head. Wittgenstein writes:

> It is misleading then to talk of thinking as of a "mental activity". We may
> say that thinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. This
> activity is performed by the hand, when we think by writing; by the mouth
> and larynx, when we think by speaking; and if we think by imaging signs or
> pictures, I can give you no agent that thinks. If then you say that in such
> cases the mind thinks, I would only draw your attention to the fact that you
> are using metaphor, that here the mind is the agent in a different sense
> from that in which the hand can be said to be the agent in writing
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 6-7].

Wittgenstein explains that when we see a sentence on paper, the external
manifestation of a thought, we assume that some analogous structure exists
somewhere in the mind. Perhaps, Wittgenstein speculates, we could even observe
the brain directly, in the process of writing, to check whether mental states
could correspond in some way to the inscription. Both phenomena, brain- and
paper- bound, express thought. Yet neither makes sense in isolation. Rather,
we are witnessing the workings of a metaphor: the transference of properties
between two distinct locations, one in the head and one on paper. Neither
physical nor mental descriptions of these processes alone are sufficient for
Wittgenstein to locate cognition. The subject escapes depending on our point
of view. When the hand writes, it is the brain that thinks. But when the hand
thinks, it is the brain that writes. One must understand both sides of the
equation. Meaning in that sense lies in the transition from hand to head and
from mind to paper. "Where does thinking take place?" he asks. It takes place
"on paper, in our head, in the mind." Crucially, "none of these statements of
locality gives *the* locality of thinking" [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16].
Thought is rather distributed throughout the body and among the its
extensions. We think by the pen, hand, mouth, and sign.

"Can a machine think?" Wittgenstein asks later on in the first notebook
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16]. The problem, as he explains, is not one of
finding a machine that can do the job---of manipulating signs, for example.
It lies in the ability of the machine to enact both sides of the metaphoric
equation. "Doing the job," the manipulation of external signs, must correspond
to something else. Severed from some other analogical structure, the "blind"
manipulation of signs is a meaningless activity. Meaning, Wittgenstein
suggests, resides simply in this analogy between something (symbol) and
something else (physical state of a system). The question then can be better
rephrased as "can a machine have private mental states?" Can it feel pain in
the sense of pain being a state of internal affairs not accessible to others
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16, 46-9]? If we believe machines to be capable of
having internal private states, we can then imagine something like machine
intelligence, by which a spoken word or letter could find the appropriate
inward representation for the machine. We return to the sense of accord,
however vague, between the internal and external.

Wittgenstein extends his thought experiments about thinking machines in his
*Brown Notebook.* Let us study what is meant by "reading," he suggests early
on. By reading, he means the activity of "translating script into sounds," "of
writing according to dictation," or "of copying in writing a page of print"
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 119]. Reading once again is "mechanical" reading,
without a sense of "understanding" or interpretation. What happens when a
child reads a newspaper, for example?, Wittgenstein asks echoing Kuhlman and
Descartes. The child's eyes "glide along the printed words, he pronounces them
aloud or to himself, but other words he pronounces after having seen their
first few letters only, others again he reads out letter by letter." The child
acts as a "reading machine" when he pays no attention to what he reads, even
when he speaks the words out loud. He reads "faultlessly like a reliable
machine," Wittgenstein repeats, emphasising the mechanical property of
colloquially "mechanistic" reading. Another hypothetical child merely pretends
to read. She guesses at the words and on occasion repeats things "by heart,"
without actually seeing them on the page [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 121-22].
Would any of these hypothetical scenarios rise to our understanding of what
reading should entail?

Wittgenstein continues to complicate such edge cases, challenging his
audience's intuitions of what it means to read and to understand. He gives
also the example of a hallucinating patient, who "reads" what to us looks like
gibberish, and the case of a man who fakes reading Cyrillic by memorizing the
lines phonetically. He talks of machines too, which produce random sounds that
occasionally, by accident, correspond to some existing texts. In each case, we
envision two mechanisms, Wittgenstein writes, one visible and external and one
hidden and internal. To read, the reader must do more than go through the
motions of reading. Outward signs of reading are insufficient to indicate
comprehension. The physical motions---of gliding one's eyes across the page
and saying the words out loud---must connect in some way with appropriate
internal, mental representations.

We are tempted then to privilege the inward-facing signs of comprehension as
the "real criterion for a person's reading or not reading." However, no such
internal mechanisms can be known to us or communicated to others properly,
Wittgenstein writes [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120]. We can only intuit the
reader's private experience of reading. Absent first-hand access to private
mental states of another, a reading pupil must convince his teacher that the
scanned sign had the intended effect through language. This requires even more
words in a sort of an interrupted hermeneutic feedback loop, the two sides of
which do not quite connect to complete the circuit. To convince Socrates that
he did more than memorize the recited words, Phaedrus must use more words,
which are similarly unconvincing. What if those are memorized as well?  What
can be done to convince others definitively of our having understood a text
properly?

Wittgenstein finally describes the mechanisms of reading as an "indirect way
of transmitting a feeling." "Something that we can never know happens at the
other end" of the communication act [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 185].
Communication, we would say today, is always mediated. In the conclusion of
his notebooks, Wittgenstein imagines the possibility of unmediated, "direct"
modes communication, capable of transmitting feelings from one person to
another, in a way that "obviate[s] the external medium of communication
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 185]" Barring that possibility, we are ultimately
limited by our private sensations of knowledge. "Something which we can never
know happens at the end end," Wittgenstein writes [@wittgenstein_blue_1965,
185]. Any sense of affirmation, the phatic utterance---Can you hear me
now?---comes through further expression, entailing further uncertainty.

Thought experiments in *The Blue and Brown Notebooks* do not amount to a
cohesive model of language, communication, or the mind. They do however
contain the seeds of the reading and writing machines later imagined by Alan
Turing at the formative sources of contemporary computing. Wittgenstein's
experimental thought machines prefigure the conversation on machine
intelligence. Wittgenstein conjures his fantastical broken mechanisms to test
the limits of our intuitions about reading, writing, and comprehension.

*Philosophical Grammar,* written around the same time as the *Blue and Brown
Notebooks*, gives us another glimpse into the pre-history of the literary
device. It begins again with a problem of "understanding" and "not
understanding." "To understand language," Wittgenstein writes, means "to take
in symbolism as a whole" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 5]. A word is
always a part of a larger system. Similarly, a pass in football (soccer) also
only makes sense as part of the game. It is meaningless in isolation. From the
start of his argument, Wittgenstein envisions "understanding" as a type of
trans-mediation. In comparing the understanding of language propositions to
music, he writes: "for explanation I can only translate the musical picture
into a picture in another medium and let one picture throw light on the other"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 5 & 41]. And elsewhere: "How curious: we
should like to explain the understanding of a gesture as a *translation* into
words, and the understanding of words as a translation into gestures [emphasis
mine]" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 42]. In conclusion, he again
describes what we mean by "understanding" as a "process of translation from
one symbolism into another; tracing a picture, copying something, or
translating into another mode of representation." To understand something said
is thus akin to modeling it in clay or drawing it
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 45]. Whatever is meant by "understanding"
comes through the comparative transference between media: a translation or
trans-mediation. In this way we may imagine explaining the rules of basketball
to someone who only knows how to play hockey by analogy: the puck bares a
grammatical resemblance to the ball, the goal net to the basketball hoop.

It is insufficient however to merely paraphrase something: to show
understanding one must "draw a picture" or "model" in a way that reveals the
correspondence of equivalent structures. Language cannot be explained in
language, for example.  One must trade symbolisms in a sense, creating a model
that explains one representational system in terms of another. This process is
not exact. For example, how would one account for the differences between
balls and pucks, or explain to what extent a "clay model" corresponds to a
"language model" of something? The media are not fully equivalent: air and
clay, ice and grass. Consequently, the games are played by different rules
that answer to distinct physics.

In thinking of the various ways in which the process of translation between
divergent symbolisms breaks, Wittgenstein continually returns to the pianola,
a type an automatic player piano. A player piano connects the music score to
the mechanism in a rigid way. The mechanism and symbolic notation become one.
The mechanism does not "interpret." Perforated paper physically actuates the
appropriate pins and gears and always in the same manner. As long as the
mechanism functions properly, musical notation and the internal arrangement of
instrument parts stand in accord. The rigidity of the connection assures a
correspondence in symbolisms. The machine enacts an exacting translation from
one medium to the next by mechanical means, as the actuating mechanisms of the
player piano fit into the grooves of a music roll.

![Electrically operated musical instrument by Clyde Coleman of Chicago, Il.
1914, US1107495A. Wittgenstein returns to the image of pianola throughout his
writings.](images/pianola.png)

This sort of a rigid correspondence brings us closer to an answer to the
"proper interpretation" problem. But, like the other, less exacting,
mechanisms of comprehension, the pianola can break too. In the early passages
of *Philosophical Grammar*, Wittgenstein explains: "Aren't our sentences parts
of a mechanism? As in a pianola? But suppose it is in bad condition? So it is
not the effect but the purpose of the signs (the holes in the pianola roll).
Their purpose *within* the mechanism" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 10].
Wittgenstein elaborates a few pages later:

> The sentences that we utter have a particular purpose, they are to produce
> certain effects. They are parts of a mechanism, perhaps a psychological
> mechanism, and the words of the sentences are also parts of the mechanism
> (levers, cogwheels, and so on). The example that seems to illustrate what
> we're thinking of here is an automatic music player, a pianola. It contains
> a roll, rollers, etc., on which the piece of music is written in some kind
> of notation (the position of holes, pegs, and so on). It's as if the written
> sign gave orders which are carried out by keys and hammers
> [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 69].

As was the case with reading automata in *The Blue and Brown Notebooks*,
Wittgenstein again substitutes a physical mechanism for the process of
symbolic interpretation. In this view, words and music notation alike contain
a "purpose" to elicit some "effects" in the interpretive mechanism. As before,
we cannot always expect the mechanism of interpretation to function properly,
nor do we have a reliable way to verify its correct operation. "Suppose the
pianola is in bad condition," Wittgenstein repeats. The signs on the roll
could produce "hisses and bangs" instead of music, for example. One could
object that notes are always "meant" to play on a mechanism in perfect working
order. But to explain what is meant by a working order, we would need to draw
yet another diagram or build another machine. Wittgenstein elaborates by
another analogy: the "sense" of an "order"---the programming instructions of
the piano roll---lies in its "effect on an obedient man"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 60-70]. The pianola thus exemplifies a
class of perfect controlling mechanisms. In good working condition it is
exactly obedient to the instructions printed on a piano roll.

When drawing the analogy between mental and mechanical processes, Wittgenstein
explicitly rejects the model of language as a "psychophysical" mechanism.
Rather, as the title of the work suggests, Wittgenstein is in search for the
"grammar" governing the engagement: between speakers and listeners, readers
and writers, player pianos and musical scores. By the end of the work, grammar
emerges as a batch of "conventions." Wittgenstein complicates the mechanism by
inserting an extra layer of "rules" that mediate between symbol and machine or
mental state. We can agree upon a convention formally, by transcribing into a
protocol: a chart of appropriate correspondences that describes the exact
rules of engagement. Wittgenstein writes that it would be then possible to
imagine a "part of the mechanism which resembles the chart [...] inserted
between the language-part of the mechanism and the rest of it"
[@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 190]. Such instructions would enforce
strict compliance between the musical score and the actuating parts of the
piano mechanism, sounding a warning bell for example, if any part of the
mechanism was out of compliance.

"Can one say that grammar describes language?" Wittgenstein writes:

> If we consider language as part of the psycho-physical mechanism which we
use when we utter words---like pressing keys on a keyboard---to make a human
machine work for us, then we can say that grammar describes that part of the
machine.

The grammar sets up a "connection between word and a thing," in order for the
mechanism to "function in a certain way." "So the definition can make it work
properly, like the connection between the keys and the hammers in a piano"
Wittgenstein writes. Crucially, it is that "connection not the effect that
determines the meaning" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 190]. A programmer
would say that Wittgenstein's "grammatical layer" resembles modern programming
language interpreters and assemblers, exactly the parts of the machine that
connect codified instructions to their execution [@mccarthy_lisp_1962;
@bashkow_system_1967]. Similarly, Wittgenstein's grammar "means" in the sense
of specifying the rules by which meaning succeeds or fails. In this way, we
can move away from speaking of "intended effects" or "proper obedience," and
rather concentrate on this interpretive and mediating layer, which describes
the rules of engagement [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 194-6]. To learn a
language in that sense is not to learn individual words, but to understand the
rules of engagement: the mechanical linkages of meaning-making.

## Thought Experiment III

Turing met Wittgenstein at King's College sometime in the 1930s. Although
there are no records of them meeting explicitly until Turing's attendance of
Wittgenstein's lectures on the foundation of mathematics in 1939, both men's
work exhibits sustained attention to computing machines narrowly and to the
mechanical manipulation of symbols more generally
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 7]. From the notes on Wittgenstein's
lectures complied and published by Cora Diamond, it is clear that Turing was a
vociferous presence in the class. His name is mentioned eighty-six times in
the text, more than any other student by a wide margin.[^ln1-margin] At some
point of the course Wittgenstein concludes his lecture in saying:
"Unfortunately, Turing will be away from the next lecture, and therefore that
lecture will have to be somewhat parenthetical. For it is not good my getting
the rest to agree to something that Turing would not agree to"
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 67-68].

Like he did with the notebooks beforehand, Wittgenstein structured his
lectures around the problem of symbolic interpretation. "I am going to talk
about the interrelation of mathematical symbols," Wittgenstein begins. We
imagine that logical laws represent some sort of "fixed" mechanisms "behind"
the symbols used to express them. "I am speaking against the idea of logical
machinery," Wittgenstein says in Lecture XX. "The idea of logical machinery
would suppose that there was something behind our symbols"
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 194]. We imagine logic to be a sort of a
"rigid mechanism" that can only turn this way or the other. "Any rule can be
imagined to be a description of a mechanism---even the rule which says a pawn
must not be moved in a certain way," Wittgenstein writes
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 282]. The parts of the mechanism
subsequently exist in a causal relationship to one another. Pushing this or
that lever will always result in such and such movement, because of the way
the mechanical parts are connected. We say that the mechanism is rigid or the
law is inexorable when the results of an action are absolutely fixed.
Wittgenstein calls such a relationship "super-hardness." Where a judge can be
lenient, he explains, the law is compulsory. What we would now call an
"algorithm" compels predictable execution, not subject to the vagrancies of
interpretation.

We are tempted, as before, to privilege the inner workings of the symbolic
mechanism, also at the core of meaning making in mathematics. "If I show you
the mechanism behind the [watch] dial, you will be able to predict the
movement of the hour hand for any given movement of the minute hand,"
Wittgenstein writes. But once again, how do we know if a mechanism is
functioning properly? I may drop the clock, for example, Wittgenstein
explains, "so that the machinery is broken, or a lighting may strike it.
[@wittgenstein_wittgensteins_1976, 195]" To check the mechanism for damage we
need "a picture," a diagram, or schematics that describe what the properly
functional mechanism looks like. In the form of a schema, the mechanism is
itself a type of a symbol for the perfected behavior of the sort that we
expect. We can, for example, compare the broken clock with a clock that works.
Where we tried to find the mechanism behind the symbol, we found also the
symbol behind the mechanism. But again we struggle to complete the circuit of
interpretation between intent and effect, which never quite manage to explain
and to verify each other. How do we know that our "gold standard" clock
schematics are themselves golden, that is that they lead to the construction
of properly functioning clocks? We are again faced with a series of receding
analogies: a diagram that explains a diagram.

In his lectures on mathematics, Wittgenstein never finds a way out of this
recursive conundrum. The foundations of mathematics rely on some such mutually
dependent relationship between the physical and the symbolic worlds. Whether
it is in math or in ordinary language, some magic happens at the coupling of
matter and sign. The precise point of contact concerns Wittgenstein in all
fields of human activity, from literature to psychology and mathematics. In
all of these fields, Wittgenstein finds an implicit analogy between "symbol"
and "mechanism." A type of a metaphor, the analogy itself is atomic. It cannot
be split further into something like sign and referent, or signifier and
signified. Considered apart, the two parts of the metaphor are strictly
meaningless. In his lectures on aesthetics, Wittgenstein describes the
dependency as the "concomitance between mechanism and its trace." The best we
can do in describing aesthetics is therefore to "trace a mechanism"
[@wittgenstein_lectures_1966, 13-16].

One expects Turing's seminal paper on computable numbers to contain a strictly
technical discussion in the narrow field of number theory. Instead, we
encounter also a number of excess features, which do not fit neatly into
mathematics. The excess accounts for the perplexing, for some, undercurrent of
cognitive theory always present in Turing's writing. His machines "think,"
they are "aware," and they "remember," where his humans "calculate" and
"compute." The cognitive excess reflects the heritage of Wittgenstein's
thought, concerned more broadly with theory of mind and the passage of
inscription into understanding. Turing's machine thinks in a particularly
literate way: by ingesting and regurgitating symbols. Turing inherits these
traits from Wittgenstein's menagerie of comprehension automata in various
states of disrepair. In the wilderness of Wittgenstein's thought he locates
the concise coordinates for a universal mechanism, placed at the liminal space
between thing and symbol. The Turing machine mediates in the metaphoric
transference from intrinsic "hard" states to their extrinsic "soft"
representations. Like its predecessors it reflects a concern with the grammar
of that transformation, and ultimately with the mechanisms of exacting
obedience: fully deterministic systems that are nevertheless capable of
transgressing their formal constraints. "How can the rules of operation of the
machine change?" Turing asks later, in his "Computing Machinery and
Intelligence" [@turing_computing_1950]. What begins as a blueprint for a
computing machine in the 1930s by 1950s matures into a conversation between a
poet and her critic; into the possibility of an evolving artificial
intelligence; and into an imitation game, by which the computer misrepresents
its assigned gender. How does a machine escape its programming? How can a poet
transcend the rules of composition? How do humans become more than the sum of
their nature and nurture? The Turing machine challenges not only the limits of
computable numbers but also the limits of determinism.

Turing's universal machine distills a number of Wittgenstein's experiments
into a minimally viable formula. It needs the following three components to
function: (a) a storage medium capable of holding symbolic inscription, (b) a
reading and writing mechanism to operate on the symbols, and (c) a way to
transform external symbolic states into internal states of the mechanism.
Given these three characteristics, the machine becomes a universal mechanism.
The universal Turing machine can assume the function of any other machine, as
long as that machine's internal states are amenable to symbolic
representation.  Dwell on that thought because it is key to understanding
Turing machines. Is a hammer, for example, capable of holding internal states?
I can imagine a hammering robot but not a robotic hammer.  Why? The robotic
hammer immediately presupposes a machine within the instrument. The sense of
inferiority makes the hammer into something else, namely a machine capable of
following hammering instructions. The ability to follow instructions, to
imitate technique, is what separates a simple tool from a Turing machine. A
number of such possible symbolic machine states comprise the input of Turing's
universal machine. In Wittgenstein's terms, Turing imagines a mechanism able
to "trace the mechanism" of all other mechanisms. In this lies the essence of
universal Turing computation.

Let us examine the universal machine more carefully. Turing begins his paper
as we would expect from Wittgenstein's student, with an analogy: "we may
compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a machine that is
only capable of a finite number of conditions" [@turing_computable_1937, 231].
In effect, he asks his readers to compare computation, a human mental process,
to the mechanical action of a machine. As Charles Petzold explained it in his
book-length annotation on Turing's paper, Turing "makes reference to 'states
of mind' that are analogous to machine states" [@petzold_annotated_2008, 67].
When read in the context of Wittgenstein's thought experiments, the analogy
sounds like a provocation. Neither mathematicians nor philosophers of mind
agreed then nor do they now on the extent to which states of mind can be
compared to discrete machine states. Turing provocatively slides into the
language of cognition to reinforce the analogy between mind and mechanism. His
machines "think" and his humans "compute" throughout.

Turing further imagines a machine "supplied with a 'tape' (the analogue of
paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called 'squares') each
capable of bearing a 'symbol'" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. Much like a
movie reel, the tape moves through the mechanism one section at a time. At
each point only one section bearing one symbol can be said to be "in the
machine." "We may call this square the 'scanned square,'" Turing writes and
continues:

> The symbol on the scanned square may be called the "scanned symbol." The
> "scanned symbol" is the only one of which the machine is, so to speak,
> "directly aware" [@turing_computable_1937, 231].

The scanned symbol becomes a part of the machine's internal configuration, or,
to slide into the cognitive vocabulary along with Turing, a part of its
"awareness." In Turing's words, "the machine can effectively remember [!] some
of the symbols which it has 'seen' (scanned) previously"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The machine's "behavior" is therefore
determined by its initial configuration---the arrangement of tape and scanning
apparatus---plus the scanned symbol. The scanned symbol becomes a part of
machine "memory." To paraphrase today, I would say that the mechanism
translates software into hardware and the other way around, in a process of
translation between thought and thing already suggested in Wittgenstein
thought experiments.

We imagine then a device not unlike a telegraph or a film projector, which
ingests reels of tape. But unlike telegraphs or film projectors, the ingested
symbolic representation becomes, by definition, a part of the machine's
internal state in a way that telegraph tape or film reels do not when it comes
to telegraphs and film projectors. The film reel and the ticker tape pass
through the mechanism without leaving a trace. The tape of the Turing machine
alters the machine's internal configuration in a way that lasts beyond the
tape's discharge from the mechanism.

If you recall Wittgenstein's earlier thought experiments in this vein, he too
spoke of humans in the process of reading or doing mathematics who similarly
"ingest" symbols; of the need to internalize external symbolic states; and of
affecting a change in mental states, on some real and empirically observable
neurological level, that correlate to the symbol. Turing's machine is capable
of such ingestion. It "thinks," "reads," and "remembers" to the extent of its
capability to scan and internalize symbolic inscription. The Turing machine in
effect gives us a concise and minimally viable definition of "reading" and
"becoming aware." Proper reading for Turing simply involves the appropriate
internalization of the symbol, for both human and machine.

In addition to "reading," Turing's machine also writes. Turing explains that
"in some configurations in which the scanned square is blank (*i.e.* bears no
symbol) the machine writes down a new symbol on the scanned square"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The machine should thus also be capable of
erasing and moving symbols to adjacent squares, one square at a time. Reading,
writing, and symbolic manipulation are all actions at the core of Turing's
computation. More than simple scansion, a Turing machine is capable of
altering the rules of reading. If we take "reading" to initially entail
"moving our eyes from left to right," for example, we must also imagine
machine symbols that stand for instructions like "now move from right to
left," or, "skip every other character." The configuration state of the
machine determines the movement of the "reading" and "writing" apparatus along
the surface of the tape. Unlike an analog watch, to use a simple example, the
mechanism of the Turing machine is not "set in stone." It is capable of
altering its own inner works. In this action, some of the scanned symbols
represent computable numbers, or data as we would say today, on which
computation is performed. Yet other symbols represent machine instructions,
which define the rules of computation. This type of instructional symbol
direct the movement of the reading and writing heads, which "write," "scan,"
or "erase" symbols. Today, we would call such instructions "programs,"
"applications," or "software." Control codes and computed data within a Turing
machine form a part of the same continuous stream of information. Computation,
in the Turing sense, entails the transference between symbolic and solid
states of being.

Just as the Turing machine is able, in theory, to convert extrinsic signs into
intrinsic physical configuration states, it can conversely enact the opposite
movement, by representing internal configuration symbolically. This remarkable
property allows for what Turing calls a class of *universal* machines,
distinct from mere single-purpose computers. Specific Turing machines can be
configured to perform specific actions like addition or multiplication. But
the multiplication machine cannot, for example, be reconfigured for another
purpose, because the physical movement of its internals is fixed. An
electronic scale, for example, is built for one purpose only. It cannot be
used to process text or calculate missile trajectories. An adding machine can
only add. The universal Turing machine by contrast has the ability to
internalize *other machine configurations*. Such a machine can, in Turing's
words, "compute any computable sequence" [@turing_computable_1937, 241]. In
being able to internalize physical configuration as symbol, the universal
Turing machine gains the ability to simulate all other special-purpose Turing
machines, as long as these machines are amenable to symbolic representation.
For this reason, Turing computation excludes non symbolic, mechanical action
like hammering nails or harvesting grain. The Turing machine simulates
symbolic manipulations. It is a trace of a trace; a diagram of diagrams. The
technique is the thing being simulated, not the action itself. In this way,
the basic mechanism of reading and writing of symbols along tape gives rise to
all higher level symbolic manipulations.

The transition of symbols into machine states (and the other way around)
defines modern programming. Unlike other, definitive, single-purpose and
limited-state mechanisms (a clock for example), a universal machine contains
the ability to take on differing internal symbolic configurations. It can
imitate a clock, an abacus, a scale, a book. In a later paper that links
computing machinery and intelligence, Turing implied also that his machine
could eventually simulate human thought, because he saw the mind as another
way of manipulating symbols [@turing_computing_1950].[^ln1-compete] Are minds
just types of Turing machines or are Turing machines a kind of mind? Turing
leaves the door open for either possibility. The universal Turing machine
finally encapsulates a model of computation itself. It is capable of computing
anything computable. In substituting the concept of computability with
"effective computability" Turing's paper belongs to the annals of mathematical
theory. It continues to elicit conflicting responses widely because much of it
contains also the tantalizing possibilities that bear on symbolic manipulation
generally, including ideas about human cognition and comprehension. From its
opening lines, we are asked to consider the similarity between humans and
machines in the process of thinking. Turing consistently describes machine
states in terms of "states of mind," "awareness," and "memory." These
descriptions hint at the impact of computation more broadly, beyond
mathematical theory. Besides offering mathematical proof, the paper embarks on
an experimental, ludic even, enterprise in the spirit of Wittgenstein's
playful experimentation, which often involved altered states of mind, drugs,
delirium, madness, and outright deception.

Reconstructing the influence of Wittgenstein's thought on Turing affirms the
unexpected place of Turing's "On Computability" in the conversation about
language, reading, and the structure of comprehension. Seen in the light of
Wittgenstein's philosophy, Turing's work and consequently the early history of
computing acquires a broader significance, beyond the narrow confines of the
*Entscheidungsproblem*, the problem the paper addressed explicitly. In 1936,
on the eve of World War II, Turing imagined more than a formula: it was a
thing that could explore the limits of theory, and a theory that identified a
new class of emerging things. Through Turing's well-documented involvement in
Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, actual Turing
machines changed the nature of warfare: used at first to break encrypted
military communications and then to compute missile trajectories. But as I
have argued here, Turing machines also changed humanity's relationship to
symbolic thought. They belong also to an intellectual tradition of distinctly
humanist thinking about reading, writing, text, and interpretation.

## Device

It is important to remember that in 1936 Turing's machine remained a thought
experiment---not yet an actual device. Literature in computer science tends to
see universal Turing machines as algorithms: virtual and symbolic abstractions
from hardware. Yet it is impossible to entirely dissociate the implementation
from the idea. The Turing machine "abstracts away from the complexity of real
computer architectures," Thomas Haigh recently wrote for the *Communications
of Computing Machinery*. It appeals to the theorist precisely because it is a
theory. Haigh writes that "hardware and software" are interchangeable to the
theorist, but not to the historian" [@haigh_actually_2014]. In his 1937 review
of Turing's "On Computable Numbers" paper, Alonzo Church, the American
mathematician whose work anticipated Turing's (independently) in several
important aspects, would similarly acknowledge the material foundations of
Turing computing. "A human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and
explicit instructions can be regarded as a kind of a Turing machine," he wrote
[@church_computable_1937, 42-3; also cited in @petzold_annotated_2008, 63].
Disregarding the broader, metaphysical implications of that statement, note
for now the persistence of two essential implements required for the minimally
viable operation of the Church-Turing human and machine calculators. Pen and
paper assert themselves through the abstraction.[^ln1-abstraction]

To encounter the universal Turing machine underpinning the electronic book *as
a mechanism*, the media and book historian will find that it borrows from a
number of extant designs, which, together and incrementally, give the
universal Turing machine its physical form. Once we have grasped the notion of
the Turing machine as a piece of software, an algorithm, I am compelled to
wonder about its history as a mechanism and ask, what are its technological
antecedents? What would happen, for example, if Turing attempted to patent his
device? What prior art would he cite in his patent application? In an answer
to these questions we discover that the Turing machine belongs to a long
lineage of controlling devices. The electronic book belongs to the same
history by association.

Most of the minimal physical requirements to build a universal Turing machine
were within reach in the 1930s, at the time Turing authored his influential
paper. In practice, his proposal would require first an apparatus capable of
"scanning" and "erasing" a "finite number of symbols." Second, we would need
what Turing calls "one-dimensional paper," divided into discrete squares "like
a child's arithmetic book."[^ln1-infinite] Furthermore, we would need some
sort of a mechanism to advance tape through the machine, or, alternatively, to
propel the scanning mechanism along the length of the tape. Having assembled
these elements, our creation would look roughly like a cross between a
telegraph, a film projector, and a typewriter.[^ln1-davey]

Were we to patent the Turing machine in the United States, at the time of its
invention, the above elements would find prior art in mechanisms such as the
"Numeral adding or subtracting attachment for type-writing machines,"
"Combined Type-writing and Computing Machine," "Computing Attachment for
Typewriters," "Computing Mechanism," and "Combined Type-writing and Adding
Machine" among others [@daugherty_numeral_1894; @degener_combined_1911;
@wright_computing_1914; @wright_computing_1915; @ellis_combined_1914]. All of
these devices contain some combination of a reading and writing "head,"
storage tape, and movement mechanism as per Turing's specifications. A number
of inventions at the end of the nineteenth century relate specifically to
"circuit-controlling devices controlled by a traveling perforated strip or
tape," as is the case with tape-driven telegraph transmitter filed by Charles
Cuttriss in 1893 [@cuttriss_telegraphy_1893]. Prior to perforated tape, the
transmission of messages by telegraph required the presence of a skilled
operator, able to transcribe messages from text to Morse code, and into the
physical motion of a lever-operated circuit. In the operation of early
telegraphy, the human operator acted as a mute interpreter between text and
telegraph. The transcription of text into signal, and back onto paper,
required the real-time presence of human encoders and decoders. The perforated
tape decoupled the human from the machine.

In US patent #1187035 (1916) on "Telegraphy", Albert and Ralph Bumstead
explain: "the object of our invention is to provide a system of telegraphy
which does not require skilled operators for the transmission and reception of
messages" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916]. Instead, the message was transcribed
into perforation via mechanical means and then fed into the mechanism. The
tape mechanics of the typewriter could then be coupled with the electrics of
the telegraph, where perforated tape could mediate between the two "worlds" of
mechanics and electricity. A number of contraptions emerged at the time with
the aim of transfiguring the mechanical action of the typewriter into
perforation, and, consequently, perforation into script, completing the
circuit between automated "encoding" and "decoding." As one machine converted
human input into mechanical states and into signal, another machine converted
signals into mechanical states and thereon into human-legible messages.

A multitude of inventions capitalized on the control capabilities of removable
storage media by the beginning of the of the twentieth century. These included
machines for tape-controlled telegraphic transmission, tape-controlled
printing, printing telegraphs, and remote broadcast programming devices for
radio and television content [@wheatstone_improvement_1874;
@murray_tape-controlled_1905; @bumstead_telegraphy_1916; @creed_printing_1911;
@hallden_printing-telegraph_1929; @vriendt_program_1934;
@brown_automatic_1936; @brown_selective_1936]. With the invention of punch
cards and perforated tape (also used in textile looms, as early as 1725), a
message meant for another human became also a physical medium---bumps and
holes---used to animate the mechanical movement of the transmission apparatus.

For example, of the 33 asserted claims in the Bumstead brothers' "Telegraphy"
patent, the first 13 relate to the "transmission of intelligence,"

> [...] adapted to initiate a succession of electrical impulses all of which
> have a character representing significance, a receiver adapted to detect
> variations in time intervals elapsing between successive impulses, a
> plurality of interpreting relays selectively actuated by said receiver, and a
> printed mechanism responsive for the combined action
> [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12-13].

What begins as a description of a mechanism for information transmittal, ends
with a claim about hermeneutics of control. Starting with clause 14, the
brothers begin to describe "a telegraph system" capable of "transmitting
impulses" at varying time intervals. In the language of the patent, the length
of the time interval "represents significance," involving an automated
receiver responsible for "distributing, interpreting, and recording." The
printing mechanism is further "arranged to print the interpretation of the
signals which is made by the interpreting relays" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916,
6]. The interpreting relays transform time intervals into a "typographical
form" representing "a letter, a figure, or other characters," "in accordance
with a code" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 13]. Initially, the telegraph prints
to "transmit intelligence." But the authors also understand that the varying
time intervals could also signify other information, meant to actuate a
variety of devices. By the middle of the patent, the brothers refer to their
invention in terms of a "controlling medium," capable of operating everything
from typesetting machines to more general "sunflower switches." "Indeed the
detector and the interpreting relay could be made to actuate a set of
sunflower switches for an indicator without including a printer at all," the
authors conclude [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12].

Along with hundreds of similar inventions patented around the turn of the
twentieth century, the Bumstead brothers describe a mechanism that could
function as a Turing machine with little modification. The automated
telegraph, driven by ticker tape and connected to a printer, contains all the
necessary requirements set out by Turing: a discrete symbolic language, the
removable storage medium, and a device that can alter its internal states
based on the reading and writing of scanned symbols. These machines are able
read and write: they ingest tape and they are capable of converting extrinsic
symbols into intrinsic machine states. By 1905, Donald Murray, the inventor of
the popular Murray telegraph, could write that "if we disregard the small
class of telegrams that merely express emotions, *the essence of telegraphy is
control* [emphasis mine]." He wrote also that "telegraph systems, therefore,
belong not to the class of producing or distributing, but to the class of
controlling mechanisms" [@murray_setting_1905, 556]. For the automated
telegraph, control code and the message are one. The mechanism interprets some
signals as data to be manipulated and other signals as control code the rules
of data manipulation. The first type of code holds "significance" for humans,
where the second for the mechanism itself. The mechanism "transmits
intelligence" in the sense of rarefying machine states; it "interprets" in the
sense of mechanical embodiment.

By 1936, when Turing published his paper on computable numbers, these
inventions did not merely anticipate the modern computer, they were brought to
mass market in the widespread manufacture of computing scales, dial recorders,
electric tabulating machines, and computing typewriters made by companies like
Underwood Computing Machine, Electromatic, and International Business Machines
(IBM). Rather than a single eureka moment, the invention of the computer
should therefore be viewed as a gradual historical process that culminates in
Turing's universal (and minimally viable) specifications. What does the
material history of the computer mean for the history of the book? In viewing
the book as a kind of a precursor to a generalized machine of symbolic
manipulation we discover that it belongs to a class of controlling devices.

The very nature of Turing machines implies the irreversible admixture of
matter, content, and control structure. When reading a paper and cloth book,
one can definitively isolate a) the physical properties of paper and cloth
from b) the content of the book and from c) the legal and political elements
governing the production of textuality: one can tear out the copyright notice
along with the ISBN number, copy the words into a notebook, and recycle the
paper. The literary device, by contrast, ingests both symbolic representation
and control code through the same input stream.  Where images of governance
(like trademark and copyright symbols) *signify*, computed text *embodies*.
Computation enacts control in exactly the sense by which Wittgenstein suggests
the existence of "rules for obedience" between symbol and interpretation.

The limits of physical engineering pull the Turing machine back to the sphere
of the applied.[^ln1-cs] What are we to make of universal Turing machines
implemented in virtual worlds like *Wireworld* (a cellular automaton
simulation), or *Minecraft* (a procedurally generated sand-box
world-exploration game)? In the least, we must admit that such simulations do
not rest on the immaterial "turtles all the way down," unless that is, one
believes that the universe itself is a type of Turing computation
[@deutsch_quantum_1985; @lloyd_ultimate_2000; @piccinini_computational_2007].
At some point, the Turing machine in the virtual world meets the material
limits of the physical. Simulation engines like *Minecraft* and *Wireworld* do
in some sense exist in the abstract, as code or even rules written on paper.
But in another sense, they do not. They come fully into being only when
instantiated within first-order, physical constrains that involve actual
circuit boards and relay switches, or, at least, a pen and paper. For this
reason, the performance (in terms of cycles per second, instructions per
cycle, or its capacity to hold a number of instructions) of a Turing machine
simulated within a virtual world like Minecraft cannot logically exceed the
performance of the machine running Minecraft itself. The physical capabilities
of the bottom-most device limit the computational power of all *n+1* order
Turing simulations. The bottom-most turtle may have its head in the clouds,
but its feet rest firmly on the ground.

The exact plane where the symbolic meets the material is difficult to
identify. At some imperceptible point software disappears into hardware. Such
ambiguity between hardware and software leads to some controversy in the
critical literature, as evidenced by Lev Manovich's playful response to
Kittler's "there is no software" argument. If I understand it correctly,
Kittler's short but often cited essay picks up the thread of Kittler's earlier
work to posit what he calls a "postmodern writing scene." "We do not write
anymore," Kittler writes. "Human-made writing passes through microscopically
written inscriptions which, in contrast to all historical writing tools, are
able to read and write by themselves" [@kittler_there_1995]. According to this
schema, Kittler sees the paper-bound design blueprints of the first integrated
microprocessor as the last "real" piece of writing. Everything written after
that point is hardware, because all digital modes of representation, including
text, ultimately rest on physical circuit architecture. The inability to
understand hardware, in this view, precludes all higher modalities of reading,
writing, and interpretation.

Manovich inverts Kittler's argument into "there is only software," by which he
means that in a pragmatic sense, software determines the properties of any
media object. The inversion participates in the perpetual dialectics between
idealism and materialism: Hegel and Marx, Marx and Gramsci, Gramsci and
Kittler, Kittler and Manovich. "What you can do with a particular digital
media file can change dramatically," depending on the software, Manovich
writes. When it comes to digital photographs, to use his example, one
application may allow the photographer to crop the image while another may not
[@manovich_there_2011, 151]. From this property-determining aspect of software
(and in reference to the work of Alan Kay), Manovich derives the concept of
*metamedia*, "a medium that can dynamically simulate the details of any other
medium" [@manovich_there_2011, 105-6]. "Interactive software adds a new set of
operations which can be applied to all media, which we as users experience as
their new 'properties'," he writes. Furthermore, these properties vary
according to the software [@manovich_there_2011, 150-1].  Kittler (who passed
in 2011) could perhaps object that chip architecture still determines, as
foundation, all higher levels of representation "floating" above the silicon
bedrock. In other words, everything Manovich writes is true for all simulated
media, but not for computation itself. In opening a series of nested software
black boxes, the post-silicon writer and scholar of software hits the
impenetrable casket of chip architecture. The hardware that gives rise to the
simulation is not in itself a simulation. It therefore ultimately determines
the "properties" of software, the metamedium.

Wittgenstein's thought experiments do not let us fall definitively into one
camp or another. The Turing machine remains a machine for translating symbolic
information into physical states. We arrive finally at the sheer alienness of
the book as a piece of telecommunication technology. Writing converts mental
states into arbitrary external representations, inscribed into a medium. Such
inscriptions persist, through time, beyond their biological origin. They are
then conveyed remotely and through ingestion, commonly called "reading," an
action capable of transforming the inscription back into a mental state. The
thing becomes a thought and the other way around. The intellectual history of
the Turing machine leads us to a series of thought experiments about the
nature of such transformations. The question of technique returns to haunt
contemporary poetics. In the process of reading, the book escapes the
interpreter's grasp as a thing, presenting itself only as an idea. In asking
"How is it made?" we arrest the advance of symbolism in an attempt to find the
thing behind the process of signification. This process ultimately ends at the
medium, which today has the added property of being simulated. The paper page
contains no internal states to speak of. Signification therefore proceeds from
the surface inscription towards the reader. Reading, as Moreno reminds us, is
already an invasive procedure. Absent human contact, we take on the mental
states of others through a vehicle that conveys a remote kind of agency,
displaced in time and space. It should be held in view all the more because
the electronic book, unlike paper, does contain internal states of its own
which further interject in the process of signification, transmission, and
translation. How is it made, becomes the question not only for poetics but
also for the political tactics of reading.

The question of technique ultimately seeks to expose the rules of symbolic
transference between at least three discrete systems: one inorganic, the book,
one symbolic, text, and one biological, body. There is of course a way in
which the three are one: we are all in a sense cyborgs, in an assemblage of
organs, instruments, and inscriptions. But in another sense, poetics asks us
to reflect on the constructed nature of the coupling: the point of contact
being governed by rules of engagement, protocols, and translation tables.
These constructed entities grow and proliferate in a seemingly organic, ad-hoc
manner escaping our attempts at rationalization. They comprise a part of our
received technological a priori. This does not mean that they should be
naturalized or treated with a reverence afforded to endangered species or to
nature itself. To decouple ourselves from a book, if only momentarily---to
reject the graft or to let it whither---must remain an option. If poetics lays
the grounds for interpretation, we must acknowledge that today, these grounds
lie past the surface of the visible simulacrum of the page. Where literary
techniques are concerned with the transformation between ink and idea,
computational techniques extend the process from pixel to transistor. These
are embedded constructions: they are *within* and require explication.
Techniques of the body and literary techniques intertwine in the process of
conventional reading. When reading electronically, the two are coupled ever
tighter, nearer than the hand's reach. Miniaturized, the Turing machine is
itself an embedded device; it spans biological and artificial assemblies---a
symbol within a machine within a body and again the body in the machine.

In the process of textual production, printing and typesetting, it is certain
that my words were mixed with control languages, which in turn changed the
structure of the devices in your lap, in your hand, near to your eye, embedded
or embodied. I could say that I bear no responsibility for extending the reach
of machine language so close to the reader. But that would be factually
incorrect. The choice of our writing implements and our channels of
communication affect deeply the contexts of interpretation. Such choices, in
aggregate, define the shared ecosystem of knowledge production. Traditional
strategies of close reading which limit interpretation to the parsing of
visible content risk missing the concealed machinations of naked circuit
control. It looks like we are reading books, but this book may change
depending on the reader's race, gender, ethnicity, geography, or political
affiliation. Who authors or authorizes these transformations? Were a book also
a pill or fused with the neural circuitry of the brain, would you know what
and whom you were reading?

Under these conditions, it becomes increasingly more difficult to "hold away"
and to "grasp the object" apart from the subject. Some may celebrate this
moment as a triumph over Cartesian dualism, the deserved decline of humanism,
or the rightful ascendancy of an ontology oriented towards objects. These
considerations risk losing sight of the political reality that the loss of the
grounds for poetics entails. As I write these words, a North American woman
"wearing" an implanted pacemaker is fighting for her right to access its
software, in her words "to know what code is running inside my body"
[@mcgowan_i_2016]. In Pakistan, the American National Security
agency-sponsored Skynet program places people on the US-sanctioned
"disposition matrix" or "kill list" based on predictive analytics: social
network analysis, cellular machine learning, patterns of travel and telephone
use [@mcneal_targeted_2014; @weber_keep_2016]. Automated tools with names like
SMARTTRACKER, SMARTCHART, and Cloud Travel Analytic "select" people for
"target strikes" by unmanned areal vehicles. Willingly, or not, we are engaged
in the political struggle for the control and the deployment of these codified
resources. The heart and the sky are sites on which the tactics of inscription
are increasingly contested. They require a capacity to meet the machine and a
poetics capable of new emendations.

(IEEE) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). See
@glass_comparative_1992; @parnas_software_1999; @glass_analysis_2004;
@vessey_unified_2005.

[^ln1-ceruzzi]: See @ceruzzi_computing_2012, 11 who writes that "the modern
computer is a convergence of separate streams of information handling, each
with its own rich tradition of technological history." "One could add other
antecedents such as the development of radio, motion pictures, and photography"
[@ceruzzi_computing_2012, 11].

[^ln2-chomchom]: I make this connection with many caveats and with the
acknowledgement of the complexity involved. See for example Ch. 6-8 in
@hacking_why_1975; @waller_chomsky_1977; @green_bertrand_2007, 103-43.

[^ln2-compile]: I am forgoing the distinction between interpreters and
compilers for simplicity's sake. See @elbourn_evolution_1962, 1060;
@neuhold_formal_1971, 95.

[^ln1-consensus]: The literature on consensual governance, for example, going
back to Hobbes, Locke, and Mill, often touches on the problem of lapsed
consent. To paraphrase, they ask: What makes whatever compacts made by past
generations still valid today?

[^ln1-cope]: See for example @copeland_what_2000 and
@wagner_wittgenstein_2005.

[^ln1-compete]: "We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in
all purely intellectual fields" [@turing_computing_1950, 460].

[^ln1-cs]: Two separate departments offering competing degrees in software
engineering and computer science is a common occurrence in North American
universities.

[^ln1-davey]: Mike Davey built and displayed a similar instrument at Harvard
University's Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments in 2012. He
writes, "my goal in building this project was to create a machine that embodied
the classic look and feel of the machine presented in Turing’s paper.  I wanted
to build a machine that would be immediately recognizable as a Turing machine
to someone familiar with Turing's work" [@davey_turing_2012].

[^ln1-descartes]: Descartes writes in his 1637 *Discourse on Method*: "If
there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or some
other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they
were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; whereas if there were
any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our
action as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very
certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true
men." Also quoted in @dennett_can_2004, 297.

[^ln1-google]: "Google's mission is to organize the world's information and
make it universally accessible and useful" (@google_about_2015).  See also
Johanna Drucker's discussion on "the totalizing drive of the digital" in
[@drucker_digital_2001, 145].

[^ln1-infinite]: A true universal Turing machine would require a tape that is
infinitely long. See @turing_computable_1937, 249.

[^ln1-inside]: Note that these are also minimal physical requirements for
interpretation: the ability to internalize and to externalize symbolically. My
definitions do imply a sort of a dualism, but not between mind and
body---simply between inside and outside, self and other, I and not-I.  This
has been said before in many ways.

[^ln1-kant]: Or at least proceeding as if one has agency to structure one's own
experience, despite the overwhelming evidence for determinism.

[^ln1-margin]: The prominence of Turing's voice in the lecture notes could be
attributed to his later prominence.

[^ln2-moaran]: There is evidence that Ludwig Wittgenstein, the subject of this
section, read Russian and that he visited the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Both
he and Shklovsky fought in Galicia at the Eastern Front although there is no
evidence that the two men met nor knew of one another's work. See
@moran_wittgenstein_1972.

[^ln1-normal]: The process of normalization continues today as contemporary
technologies like natural language processing and optical character recognition
struggle to bring non-regularized writing systems under the computational
umbrella.

[^ln1-notquite]: To what extent a personal computer is a Turing machine is
matter of contention. The Turing machine is a *thought experiment* that
imagines a machine. The PC is a machine emulating the thought experiment. See
@putnam_representation_1988, 121-5; @chalmers_does_1996; @petzold_code:_2000. A
more detailed discussion follows in 1.2.

[^ln1-pop]: See for example @drucker_digital_2001; @golumbia_cultural_2009;
@marche_literature_2012.

[^ln2-shklov]: I rely on the Russian originals throughout, but will cite the
English translations where possible as well. See @shklovsky_voskreshenie_1914;
@shklovksy_poetika_1919; @shklovksy_art_2012.

[^ln1-turing]: The intellectual history of the Turing machine is well
established, in multiple works on the subject. It follows the Greek Diophantus,
René Descartes, Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell,
Kurt Gödel, Ludwig Wittgenstein [@petzold_annotated_2008;
@herken_universal_1988; @grattan-guinness_development_1981].

[^ln1-turingcog]: Turing's later work suggests that his use of cognitive
language throughout "On Computable Numbers" was not accidental, and that he
meant it to define sentience more generally [@turing_computing_1950].

[^ln1-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
matter, what we regard as computer instructions, and consequently what we
regard as computer programs, is determined by computers available," he writes
[@moor_three_1978, 215]. Nurbay Irmark argues that software is instead a purely
abstract artifact, akin to a musical work [@irmak_software_2012]. See also
@turner_programming_2013; @colburn_software_1999.

[^ln1-timeline]: To give you a sense of the timeline: Turing entered King's
College in 1931 [@hodges_alan_1983, 78]. His paper on computable numbers
appeared in print in 1936. It is likely that the two philosophers met at the
Moral Science Club, where by the 1930s Wittgenstein "monopolized the
discussion," even in the presence of prominent philosophers like George Edward
Moore [@duncan-jones_g._1958, 25]. Turing attended Wittgenstein's lectures on
the foundations of mathematics in 1939.

[^ln1-platotr]: I translate the passage into literal, if awkward, English to
preserve some of the interesting characteristics of the original Greek. In
particular, note the parallelism between *exōthen* and *endothen*, the
ambiguity of *allotrion*, as something that comes from another, and the subtle
slide between *graphō* (letter, figure, writing) and *tupōn* (type,
impression, trace). I extend my gratitude to Stathis Gourgouris, Simos Zenios,
and Guy Smoot for their help with the Greek translations.
