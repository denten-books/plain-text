### Infinity

### Text

and structured [@lotman].  Derrida: "Everything is a text" .  TEI people: A
text is an "ordered hierarchy of content objects" [@derose]. Goodman and
Genette.

for resemblance between documents"

collector of scratches. Object oriented ontology. Object oriented languages.

Form and Content in legal thought

When it comes to the of handbags, texts, and paintings the American legal
system grants at least four differing layers of protection. Utility patents
protect the "functional" aspects of an object. Design patents protect the
"ornamental" "look and appearance" aspects of jewelry, fashion, furniture,
beverage containers, and computer icons. Under the US Copyright Law, Section
102, copyright law protects "original works of authorship" that are "fixed in
any tangible medium of expression." Finally, the Lanham Act protects commercial
identity and distinguishes the source of commercial goods. 

Putting aside trademark law, Under the law the text cannot be a mere object. 

Language about physicality.

A derivative work is defined as "a work based upon one or more preexisting
works such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted." 17 U.S.C. § 101.

Look at a case. Threshold of originality. "non-eligibility of "textual
matter""Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc. Although a label's "graphical
illustrations" are normally copyrightable, "textual matter" is not—at least not
unless the text "aid[s] or augment[s]" an accompanying graphical illustration. 

U.S. Code: Title 35 - PATENTS

 Article One, section 8, clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution which states:

    The Congress shall have power ... To promote the progress of science and
useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the
exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries; 

design patents protect intellectual property textbook [@merges]  

35 U.S. Code § 171 - Patents for designs

Whoever invents any new, original and ornamental design for an article of
manufacture may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and
requirements of this title.  The provisions of this title relating to patents
for inventions shall apply to patents for designs, except as otherwise
provided.

The legal system "encodes" ideas of form and content. What is design? Confusion
in for Plato as well.

### Some old intro 

Athanasius Kircher's Universal Polygraphy George E. McCracken

Minimalism. Plain

Elegant Variation, Fowler

If you've never interacted with your computer through a text-based terminal,
understand for now that the command line is a sort of a call-and-response
dialog between you and your system. This way of interacting with computers
predates modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and is still commonly used by
professional programmers and system administrators.

More than an interface, the command line encapsulates a philosophy of
computing: write simple programs that do one thing well.

This philosophy contrasts sharply with alternative vision: where "things just
work," glossy visual interfaces. Surfaces and alienation. 

That computer interfaces entail politics is not an uncontroversial assumption
and one which will become central to the argument of my book.

Despite the ubiquity of Unix-like systems (which run a lion share of servers,
super-computers, Apple gadgets, and Android devices), the textual roots of
computing are obscured by visual

The battle for the soul of computing. Whether the internet empowers
participatory governance, deliberation, and dissent, or whether it ushers in a
new era of mass surveillance and centralized control depends crucially on which
of these two models of computing prevails.

> The machine is supplied with "tape" (the analogue of paper) The mechanization of type (media independence). With the invention of the
movable type and the typewriter the variability of hand-written script can be
normalized to a limited set of discrete characters. The process of
normalization continues today as contemporary approaches like natural language
processing and optical character recognition struggle to bring non-Western
writing systems under the umbrella of universal computability.

My short history of the distinction between form and content is necessarily
reductive. The situation on the ground was and continues to be more nuanced
than the dichotomy would suggest, with a number of reasonable positions between
extreme idealism and extreme materialism. It is enough however to give a sense
of what's at stake: not just a dry academic debate about the nature of art,
but the very capability of art (and don't necessarily think "high art" here) to
transform humanity. For Hegel, true art reaches for truth beyond visible forms,
transcending the deterministic material universe. The early formalists rejected
Hegel, emphasizing instead the text's outward formal properties as "devices"
capable of revitalizing stale metaphors and ossified ways of thinking.
