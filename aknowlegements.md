The digitally displaced hold on to the discomfort of the encounter with the
machine. Estrangement, always at the heart of immigrant or queer poetics,
reconciles without seeking wholeness or integration. I dedicate this book then
to queers and immigrants, literal and figurative---spatial, literary,
technological---to those being displaced unwillingly, to those exiled within
and without, to those who understand the need for self-displacement, to those
who transgress purposefully, and to those willing to trespass.
