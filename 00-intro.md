# Intro: Theory in Practice
## Pitch: Why? What's at stake? Who cares?
In this book I would like to do something unusual: to explore several key theoretical concepts in new media studies through the use of the Unix command-line interface (CLI). 

If you've never interacted with your computer through a text-based terminal, understand for now that the command line is a sort of a call-and-response dialog between you and your system. This way of interacting with computers predates modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and is still commonly used by professional programmers and system administrators.

More than an interface, the command line encapsulates a phislosophy of computing: write simple programs that do one thing well.

This philosophy contrasts sharply with altertive vision: where "things just work," glossy visual interfaces. Surfaces and alienation. 

That computer interfaces entail politics is not an uncontriversial assumption and one which will become central to the argument of my book.

Despite the ubiquity of Unix-like systems (which run a lion share of servers, super-computers, Apple gadgets, and Android devices), the textual roots of computing are abscured by visual 

The battle for the soul of computing. Whether the internet empowers participatory governance, delibiration, and dissent, or whether it ushrs in a new era of mass surveilance and centralized control depends crucially on which of these two models of computing prevails.

In the GUI world of windows and app stores, the user operates on the surface: he consumes media. Email just works (quote gmail here). The bargain with technology: it will just work but we  

In the command line world, the system operator is constantly asked to take. Things don't just work. Te 

## Intellectual affinities: Whence?
Affinities to science and technology studies, new media studies, platform studies, critical code studies, media archeology, computational culture studies. A group of media theorists discussing photography in the last few decades fail to grasp some fundamential truths about the medium divorced from the mechanics of CMOS censors, optics, and from the practice of editing images digitally in Photoshop. A conversation divorced from the material stratum of images and from the practice of photography is restricted to the surface image. It can deal only with the relationship of pixels on the screen (or dots on a page). In response to this line of critique, media studies as a field has been undergoing a practical turn from surface to materialty in practice.

Historical. 

Brings it closer to digital humanities, which is very material but often atheoretical. Theory in material and practice.

Only in this way can media studies answer the lofty goals of critique. There is no hope of reaching from the screen to the political consequences without grounding analyiss in practice. A critique in tradition of the Frankfurt school, requires furhter understanding of the economic reality of media, its legal and legilative context, issues of intellectual proprty and labor conditions. 

My approach to media theory attempts to make good on the promise. Where I often begin with philosophical 

Literary scholarship. OS as a type of literature, but not reduced to text. Text as far as the concept of text is explicitly "baked into" the system. A close reading of code and system architecture.

## Applied turn: How?
The key terms that motivate me: information, digital, data

## Audience: Who is this book for?
Broadly speaking philosophers and theoreists of media and information. As a side effect of this book will gain some
This book is meant to be read next to the computer and the reader is expected to gain some measure of profficency in Unix-like, text-driven interfaces. That profficency

For those already familiar with the command line: programmers and system administrators. Grounding practice in historical, philosophic, and political context. Reconsider seemingly mundane acts like backing f 

## Goals: what I hope to accomplish and arguments

## Narrative arc: summary

Media archeology. Applied turn in media studies. Confusion due to technical literacy.

For CS folk, grounds practice in a theoretical discussion that attracts a wider audience to computing fundamentals.


# Chapter 1: Plain Text
Key terms: data, metadata, information, binary, text, digital, analog, plain text, surface, depth
Commands: unix fs, pwd, ls, cat, wc/lc?, grep, wild cards

# Chapter 2: Vector
Key terms: Media, remediation, modes of production, modes of distribution, net neutrality
Commands: pipes, scp, rsync

Media is not the message.

# Chapter 3: Access
Security, privacy. Surveillance. Openness. Secrecy.
Commands: crypto, pgp, chmod, groups, file permissions

# Chapter 4: Interface
The book as an interface between human and computer. We must see it in the context of interfaces.

# Chapter 5: Networking
Key terms: internet, rhizome, web,  
ping, traceroute, the terminal way: multiple users. personal vs. central computers

Internet is not a rhyzome. Central control. Surface vs. depth structures--twitter is rhyzomatic on the surface.
