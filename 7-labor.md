## Chapter 7: Labor

### Moreno (book gun)

"The weakest point in our present day universe is the incapacity of man to meet
the machine, the culture conserve, or the robot, other than through submission,
actual destruction, and social revolution" [@moreno_who_1953, 233]. So wrote
the Austrian-American psychiatrist, Jacob L. Moreno between the years of 1934
and 1953, in his idiosyncratic, sprawling, and now seldom read volume, *Who
Shall Survive?* He is remembered today as a pioneer of group therapy and an
early critic of Freud and socialism. Sociologists have also recently
rediscovered his work as precursor to network analysis. His books contain
beautiful diagrams, sprouting nodes and edges, with titles like "Structure of a
Cottage Family," "A Handicraft Group," and "The Civilian Social Atom." Yet
Moreno was also a humanist and a philosopher of technology and culture. In
opposition to eugenics, popular at the time, his answer to "Who Shall Survive?"
was "everyone" [@moreno_who_1953, 245].

Humanity, according to Moreno, faces two major threats: first embodied in the
aggression from other human beings, and second, in the aggression of robots
or, what Moreno alternatively calls the "cultural conserve" and the
"zootechnical animal" [@moreno_who_1953, 237]. Robots, for Moreno, were more
than mechanized automatons. "Machine rule" encompasses all devices, social
structures, and products of the mind that diminish creativity. He writes:
"these methods have always amounted simply to this---to neglect and abandon
the genuine and outstanding creative process [...] to extinguish all the
active, living moments, and to strive towards one unchangeable goal: the
illusion of the finished, perfected product whose assumed perfectibility was
an excuse [...] for forsaking its past, for preferring one partial phenomenon
to the whole reality" [@moreno_who_1953, 233]. The "illusion of the perfected
product" reduces humans to "machine-addicts," residing in a "jungle of robots"
that threatens to suffocate all spontaneous activity. Through robots, life
then becomes a script.

In the name of comfort, safety, and prolonged life, technologists and
population planners disempower the very subjects whose lives they claim to
preserve. The zootechnical animal substitutes human ability to set goals for
the promised certainty of a better future. Moreno writes:

> The eugenic dreamer and the technological dreamer have one idea in common to
substitute and hasten the slow process of nature. Once the creative process is
encapsulated in a book it is *given*; it can be recapitulated eternally by
everybody without the effort of creating anew.  Once a machine for a certain
pattern of performance is invented a certain produce can be turned out in
infinite numbers practically without effort [...] Once that miraculous eugenic
formula will be found a human society will be given prefect and smooth at
birth, like a book of a press [@moreno_who_1953, 236].

Like king Thamus from Plato's *Phaedrus*, Moreno distrusted rote mechanization
of thought itself. All forms of externalized algorithmic rule fell under
suspicion: from central planning, to corporate governance, to machine code,
and legal codex. For Moreno, such mechanisms served to conserve and to
externalize human volition. With time, mechanized volition begins to govern
without consensus or comprehension. Splintered from its source, it staggers
forth, *golem*-like, through laws, books, and social institutions. Near
immortal, images of the past proliferate and crowd out the present.  Moreno
writes:

> Once off the press, the parent, the producer, the author is immaterial; the
> book goes to all places and to all people, it does not care where it is read
> and by whom. Many robots have further in common the attribute of comparative
> immortality. A book, a film, an atomic bomb, they do not perish in the human
> sense, the same capacity is always there, they can be reproduced *ad
> infinitum* [...] Our human world is increasingly filled with robots and there
> seems to be no end to new forms and new developments [@moreno_who_1953, 239].

In the aftermath of World War II, Moreno expanded the first edition of his
book to consider the ultimate automaton, the atomic bomb. "Mankind has been
awakened from a dream," he writes. The atomic bomb gives humanity a glimpse of
its common enemy. Technology, for Moreno, does not determine the present
situation. Rather it is a mindless actor in possession of dead and detached
human volition. It then begins to compete with living actors for survival.
Once set in motion, voluntarily, by humans, the war machine and the book alike
continue to do their bidding blindly. Such structures persist to shape the
social and the mental worlds to come. Moreno explains:

> Many of the domesticated robots are blessed with the attribute of becoming
labor-saving devices, which has, however the unpleasant consequence that they
at time reduce the need for creating, promoting with leisure also inertia.
[...] Many of the robots have also the attribute in common of being able to
affect human beings or other "targets at a distance," a book, a radio or a
television sender can entertain or teach at a distance, like a gun, a rocket
and an atomic bomb can kill people and destroy at a distance. The book is a
robot par excellence [@moreno_who_1953, 238].

For Moreno, the inertia of past decisions embodied in extant mechanisms
ultimately poses a threat for human survival. In this view, the real
competition for survival happens not between persons, sects, races, or
nations, but between humanity and its automatons from the past. The only way
to compete with the robot was for him to expand the human cultural capacity
for creation. The one advantage the biological being has over the zootechnical
animal is creative spontaneity. However, he argues that our capacity for
creative and spontaneous action has to be continually on guard against
lethargy. The machines of yore ease the burden of creativity; they weaken the
capacity for poiesis by reducing the effort necessary to bring it forth.
Moreno's therapy practice was therefore built on the principle of creative
spontaneity training, aimed at the construction of communities that
acknowledge and preserve a sense of personal agency. As far as I can tell from
the records, the practice involved group improvisation and role-play, in what
Moreno called the "techniques of freedom," which aimed to "balance spontaneous
social forces to the greatest possible harmony and unity of all"
[@moreno_who_1953, 8]. I leave Moreno's text here, with perplexing thoughts of
hydrogen bombs and books occupying the same plane of analysis.

How can a book be compared to a gun: one an instrument of peace and
edification, the other of war and destruction? When considered in the
contemporary context, several features of Moreno's provocation come into a
sharper relief. First is his attention to the volitional nature of robotics,
which for Moreno defines a field of activity that includes both books and
bombs. A bomb clearly signifies malicious intent. Following the American
school of New Criticism, it has become unfashionable to speak similarly of
intention in literary studies. When it comes to books, the critical intuition
is to treat any conjecture about authorial intent as a fallacy
[@wimsatt_verbal_1954]. But when it comes to war, our intuitions are reversed.
To understand an act of aggression is to assign responsibility and to draw
inference about its intentions. Moreno asks us to confront the book once again
as a volitional object. Even if we cannot "read" the author's mind, we can
similarly assign a measure of agency to the author in the process of creation.
Failing to produce an account of causes and effects involved, we are left
instead to ascribe volition to inanimate objects and meaning-making to chance.
The intentional fallacy frees the critic to concentrate on the pertinent and
readily observable attributes of the text. But it also obscures the flows of
agency, imbuing the word with an anthropomorphic quality; it slides into
active voice, where texts mean and languages "speak themselves."[^ln1-auto]

I do not mean to buoy the notion of authorial intent. Rather, Moreno's jarring
parallelism between books and bombs reminds the reader that both constitute a
species of displaced agency, a problem long in the background of Western
liberal thought.[^ln1-consensus] In this light, contemporary cultural anxiety
about artificial intelligence and robotics comprises a part of larger
problematics related to action delayed in time and space by symbolic means.
Technology of the word decouples readers from writers. Once decoupled,
seemingly autonomous actors---books and robots---clutter the social sphere,
continuing to structure human experience in the absence of the originating
accord. This might appear like a curious way of putting things, but not
unusual in the larger context of post-Kantian humanism at the turn of the
twentieth century. In Moreno's words we hear more than an echo of Marx's
fetishism of commodities, by which "definite social relation between men"
assumes "the fantastic form of a relation between things" [@marx_capital_1967,
72]. Moreno arrives at a similar conclusion by another logic. In creating some
of the earliest examples of social network graphs, he finds (and objects to)
the presence of things in the position of social actors.

Moreno helps us see the book in a new light. If it was always, as he
suggested, a robot for enacting action at a distance, it is all the more
robotic as a device that draws electricity, an electronic book. When in the
1930s one could view Moreno book-bombs as a fanciful---technophobic
even---view of literary technology, a century later his concern appears
pressing and prescient. The unintended consequences of disembodied and
automated agency, from artificially intelligent personal assistants to market
trading algorithms, worry scientists, legislators, and media theorists. What
looks like a book today indeed takes on the functions of a gun and a trigger.
I mean this literally: simulated text comprises a part of the same
computational platform that powers drones and aircraft carriers. Today,
computer servers in the service of the world's largest purveyors of literature
service also air traffic control and covert intelligence
[@soyata_combat:_2012; @logicworks_government_2015].

These conditions compel us---historians, philologists, et al.---to reconsider
the cozy relationship we have had with books since the advent of the Gutenberg
press. *Simulated text*, as I have been calling it here, no longer plays by
the same rules as print. The bibliographic illusion veils machine internals.
My task in this chapter is to perceive the Turing machine, the blueprint for
all computation, within the electronic book. In doing so, the literary device,
itself a powerful computer, will therefore gain meaning as a mechanism for
generalized symbolic manipulation. At the same time, I aim to place the modern
computer itself within the long history of the book, as a piece of literary
technology. To achieve my task, I will construct several pre-histories of the
literary device, first as a formal technique, then as a thought experiment,
and finally as a control mechanism. To preserve a sense of human agency and to
break the inertia of leisurely reading, we must rediscover the book as a
device; to call it forth for what it is and always was---a robot for effecting
thought at a distance; and to bring it back under the purview of
interpretation.

[^ln1-auto]: See for example @heidegger_pathmarks_1998, 57: "For the phenomenon
most worthy of thought and questioning remains the mystery of
language---wherein our entire reflection has to gather itself---above all when
it dawns on us that language is not a work of human beings: language speaks."
See also @blanchot_work_1995, 41.

[^ln1-consensus]: The literature on consensual governance, for example, going
back to Hobbes, Locke, and Mill, often touches on the problem of lapsed
consent. Roughly: What makes whatever compacts made by past generations still
valid today?

### Labor

What does it mean to write simply?

Literature hides the labor of readers and writers. In another sense, there is
also the concealment of raw, physical energy that "goes into the word." The
work it takes to get a rock up a mountain gives it potential energy to roll
back down. By definition, potential energy relates to the possibility of "work
done." The rock can pull something up the hill as it is falling down, for
example. What of the energy that went into the writing of these sentences? I
spent a few *joules* compressing the springs under my keyboard. Many more went
into my laptop as electric current. Why? To overcome matter's passive impedance
of advancing change. To preserve and to communicate this message *amperes*, the
unit of electrical flow, struggled with *ohms*, the unit of electrical
resistance.

There is energy too in the librarian's effort to archive a book, in the
churning of a search engine to make it accessible to a reading public, and in
the work of a truck driver who ferries information by road. The sum of these
energies, which seem significant now in their accumulation, went into the
writing of these words. Much of it dissipated as heat and light. And some of
it---just a small part---left an imprint somewhere. It left a trace of ink on a
page, magnetized a piece of tape, or shifted the configuration of the floating
gate buried within the solid state drive. Finally, the potential energy
remaining within the word began a chain of electrical reactions in the reader's
brain. The mental effort or reading and writing amounts to "knowledge
work."[@liu_laws_2004] Ultimately, writing serves to connect the electrical
circuitry of at least two neurological systems. Reading leaves the brain in a
different state than before. Writing, in this light, involves the transmission
of neural activity between hosts. When considered as a physical process,
literature is a type of electroencephalography (EEG), or electric head writing.

![The place of linguistic structure among "the facts of language". Saussure's
communication circuit [@saussure_course_1986, 11].](images/saussure.jpg)

Ferdinand de Saussure's paradigmatic circuit model of communication (pictured
here) follows from head to head. In *Plain Text*, I will complicate that
picture by tracing the passage of thought further from *inscription* to a
*device*. At each stage of the passage, we will observe the process of
encoding and decoding, by which one type of substance---a thought---is
converted into another type: a word or the oscillation of an electrical
current. I will present here a type of a materialist reading practice, which
pays attention to the physical properties of the communication act. I will
give that practice a name---microanalysis---and a purpose: to uncover the
energy gained or lost in the transformation from code to code and from medium
to medium.

I am concerned with energy because too often our foundational models of
reading and interpretation take the text as a fixed given. Even in our most
destabilizing readings, like Jacques Derrida's "Plato's Pharmacy", the
materiality of the text is assumed to persevere. "We will take off here from
the *Phaedrus*," Derrida writes [@derrida_dissemination_1981, 66]. "The reader
can count the lines" at the "precisely calculated center of the dialogue"
[@derrida_dissemination_1981, 67]. Plato's dialog has for Derrida a definite
beginning, middle, and end. Derrida asks the reader "to return to the text,"
even when the text "remains forever imperceptible"
[@derrida_dissemination_1981, 63 & 95].[^ln1-translate] When Derrida talks in
this usual way of a literary scholar, he uses the word "text" in two distinct
ways: one, as an abstract mental construct---the one that is "forever
imperceptible," and the physical one, which has a definite and stable
topography---the one to which we return with confidence.

In the vision of post-structural poetics, the text in the abstract resembles
the quicksand of unstable signifies. In other words, one can define a word
only in relation to other words. In this way, Derrida describes texts as
"dissimulation of the woven texture," "a web that envelops a web," and "an
organism, indefinitely regenerating its own tissue behind the cutting trace,
the decision of each reading" [@derrida_dissemination_1981, 63]. In *Plain
Text*, I want to further challenge the stability of the text as a physical
artifact. The literary device reconfigures the text dynamically in the process
of reading. Because the text is no longer fixed into a stable medium, we must
do away with page numbers, for example. Pagination changes according to the
size of the device. More intrusively, the reader cannot rely on finding the
same text upon return. The writer, the book seller, or the censor have the
technological capacity to alter the text in real time, even as the book rests
in hand or on a shelf.


### Quantity vs. Quality (microanalysis)

The reading of short stories, novels, poetry, and plays is at grave risk,
concluded the last survey of Public Participation in the Arts conducted by the
Census Bureau on the behest of the National Endowments for the Arts (NEA). 

> For the first time in modern history, less than half of the adult population
> now reads literature, and those trends reflect a larger decline in other
> sorts of reading. Anyone who loves literature, or values the cultural,
> intellectual, and political importance of active and engaged literacy
> [...] will respond to this report with grave concern" [@nea_reading_2004,
> vii]. 

Contrary to the report's findings, numbers about textuality at large tell a
different and an entirely more optimistic story.

In the 1990s, the ire of the metaphysically disaffected coursed against visual
culture and television [@stephens_rise_1998; @merrin_television_1999]. A decade
later it turned against the internet and computation, which to many threaten
the very foundations of humanity and the humanities [@golumbia_cultural_2009;
@fish_digital_2012; @marche_literature_2012].[^ln2-internet] My thesis,
presented here and throughout, is that the aims of such metaphysical angst are
misaligned. Reconstructing the physical conditions of textuality, the work
begun in the first chapter of the book, makes plain the profound alienation
from material contexts of literary production on the part of readers and
authors. Although literacy thrives, the very nature of what constitutes a
literary text changes with the advent of new material conditions. Changing
circumstances destabilize established modes of literary production, access, and
distribution tied to the circulation of paper and ink.

[^ln2-internet]: The NEA study has this to say on the topic of "What is
responsible for the decline of literary reading?": "If the 2002 data represent
a declining trend, it is tempting to suggest that fewer people are reading
literature and now prefer visual and audio entertainment. Again, the
data---both from SPPA and other sources---do not readily quantify this
explanation [...] the Internet, however, could have played a role. During the
time period when the literature participation rates declined, home Internet use
soared" [@nea_reading_2004, 30]. In his 2004 *Humanism and Democratic
Criticism*, Edward Said wrote about the "fundamental irreconcilability between
the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic," which must be sustained "as a necessary
condition of our work as humanists." The aesthetic exists in opposition to
"quotidian" experiences that we all share, writes Said: "To read Tolstoy,
Mahfouz, or Melville, to listen to Bach, Duke Ellington, or Elliott Carter, is
to do something different from reading the newspaper or listening to the taped
music you get while the phone company or your doctor puts you on hold." A
corollary to my main thesis is an argument against that commonly held belief
about the relationship between literature and aesthetics. To my mind, the
distinction is impossible to define, let alone maintain in practice. Bias in
favor of the aesthetic is bias in favor of a specific, historically  and
materially  contingent idea of the aesthetic. That preconceived idea carries
with it a hidden cost, introducing numerous blind spots into the study of
literature at large, limiting the critical task in scope and relevance. Textual
diffusion threatens not the humanity (or the humanities), but the existing
socioeconomic order that governs who gets to access, to interpret, and to
archive literature as text and document. I begin with several propositions
then: one that the literary field, understood in broad terms, is expanding, and
two, that with a quantitative expansion comes qualitative change in the
material makeup of the literary field. Where I start with a top-down,
theoretical reconceptualization of literature as an epistemological category, I
end with a bottom-up media history that traces the passage of pixel into text.

When surveying the introductory literature on literature, the reader will
invariably find a version of Said's "fundamental irreconcilability" position.
For example, in Austin Warren and Renee Wellek's *Theory of Literature* the
authors write that the "term 'literature' seems best if we limit it to the art
of literature, that is, to imaginative literature [...] the main distinctions
to be drawn are between the literary, the everyday, and the scientific uses of
language" [@wellek_theory_1949, 22]. Similarly, Raymond Williams defines it to
mean "mainly poems and plays and novels," as opposed to other kinds of
"serious" writing that are "general," "discursive," or "the sub-literary"
[@williams_keywords_1976, 152-153].[^ln2-engell] Sharing a bias in favor of
aesthetic reading with my colleagues, I would rather spend my free time reading
Kincaid or Coetzee than poring over arcane printer and telegraph manuals.
Implicit in that bias is an idea---professed by Immanuel Kant, Friedrich
Schiller, and, more recently, Tzvetan Todorov and Elaine Scarry---linked with
the belief in the connection between beauty and justice, beauty and the good,
beauty and the upright moral life. I wish to avoid disturbing the foundations
of that intellectual edifice, and only want to point out that, for some, beauty
can also reside outside of artful discourse, and that others find beauty in the
strangest of places, and that texts---their movement within and across
cultures---present many problems not exhausted by the ethic or the aesthetic
realms. Reading fiction (of a kind) for pleasure (of a kind) may indeed be a
vanishing pastime, but that is not to say that our society has gotten less
interested in literature of all kinds. On the contrary, whole new disciplines
have sprung up to deal with textual saturation: natural language processing,
narrative generation, automatic translation and summarization, computational
text analysis, discourse analysis, corpus linguistics, and digital humanities
among others.

Matters always central to the field of literary studies remain vitally
important to the functioning of modern society. Literary studies, when
conceived broadly, provide fertile grounds for collaboration between diverse
disciplines interested in the changing dynamics of narrative, interpretation,
language, form, prosody, composition, dialog, discourse, story, genre,
authorship, influence, and text. It is in this core conceptual cluster of
operational terms that I want to locate a notion of poetics, poetics capable of
addressing not only the machinations of poetry and prose, but also of pixel,
code, string, script, inscription, list, document, file, record, project, and
archive. Rather than picky epicureans of high lit, I imagine my fellow
travelers as voracious omnivores of text. My polemical aside in this chapter is
not meant to re-introduce, much less argue for a side in contentious binary
distinctions along which meta-commentary of this sort usually unfolds: science
vs. the humanities, close reading vs. distant reading. In conceiving a field of
activity to make space for this book, I cast my vote note for ether/or but for and.

This is not to say that I advocate ignorance, nor do I follow the Russian
formalist poet Vladimir Mayakovksy, who at the beginning of the last century
called on his peers to "cast Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, et al. overboard
from the ship of Modernity." foobar citation I hold instead that in the
implicit perusal of the subjectively beautiful discourse literary scholars
have abandoned vast and fecund textual vistas. In privileging the aesthetic,
the study of Literature has tied its fate to that of an increasingly vanishing
pastime---the leisurely reading of poetry and fiction, of a specific kind,
holding a privileged form, sold in preferred manner.

Hampered by an artificially limited field of activity, the study of literature
so conceived excavates a small, sacred patch of ground at the tip of an immense
textual iceberg. The results of that strenuous activity sink to join the mass
of its submerged and excavated bottom. Texts multiply and produce other texts:
that's more or less the point of Roland Barthes's 250-page exegesis of a
30-page short story by Honoré de Balzac. Despite my fond appreciation of
Barthes as a scholar, I suspect that exponential growth and diminishing returns
will eventually make (if not already have made) such relentlessly exegetic mode
of scholarship unsustainable. There are, by my approximation, over 20,000
monographs on Balzac,[^ln2-balzac] and at least as many scholarly articles on
*S/Z*.[^ln2-barthes] The value of each new "Barthes" and his associated
commentary plummets as texts multiply exponentially, quickly reaching the
limits of human comprehension. There are no winners in such an arms race
between "primary texts" and footnotes: only eventual irrelevance.

Non-positivistic disciplines like literary studies lack a methodology for
definitively settling any research program. For this reason, where the sciences
usually defer to the "last word" on any given question, citation patterns in
the humanities journals indicate that the humanities privilege historically
established sources [@tenen_digital_2014]. Without robust mechanisms for
condensing and for pruning accepted knowledge, the archive expands
precipitously. Its combined weight necessarily devalues the literature of the
present, creating a curious kind of a gap in contemporary material. A
"modernist" in literary studies denotes a specialist who works on documents
which are now more than a century old. And most departments of literature cover
only a limited range of best-sellers from the post-WWII period. A competent
graduate literature student can likely name a dozen or so contemporaneous
literary movements emerging at the turn of the twentieth century. Few in the
field are likely to name more than a handful at the turn of the
twenty-first.[^ln2-survey]

The logic of Said's eloquent defense of the aesthetic merely continues a
tradition of exclusionary distinction-making, which, before Said, denied
writers like Naguib Mahfouz and musicians like Duke Ellington a place in the
curriculum. The logic of exclusion on aesthetic basis places the critic in the
awkward role of a taste-maker, limiting research to texts that in a sense were
already "blessed" by the establishment. Scholars working on "lesser" or
"unknown" texts and writers must expend considerable energy justifying the
aesthetic merits of their chosen subject. At stake in the binary logic of
aestheticism are the very notions of "beautiful" and "quotidian" as markers of
prestige---notions that encourage disciplinary infighting, tug-of-war style, by
which much energy is spent in struggling to pull material from one category
into the other. In the meantime, the shoring up of the aesthetic detracts from
the larger aims of literary scholarship, reducing literature to its ornamental
function, as a "neat illustration" for otherwise empirical accounts of the
human condition.[^ln2-menand]

[^ln2-menand]: I am echoing Louis Menand's "the version of the humanities that
would make many non-humanists most comfortable today is the version in which
art and literature are ornaments on or neat illustrations of empirical accounts
of human life" [@menand_dangers_2005, 10-17]. 

To limit the literary to a historically contingent ideal of the aesthetic is to
limit the project of literary analysis to a moralizing, prescriptive
enterprise. A whole tradition of Marxist criticism reminds readers that
prescription cannot be ideologically neutral. "Literature does not exist in the
sense that insects do," Terry Eagleton writes in his introduction to literary
theory. "Value judgments by which it is constituted are historically variable,"
he concludes, having "a close relation to social ideologies." For Eagleton,
values are more than the simple assertion of private taste. Instead, they refer
to assumptions "by which certain social groups exercise and maintain control
over others [@eagleton_criticism_1976, 15-47]." Who controls what? My
interpretation of Marxist materialism is considerably more literal than
Eagleton's. I am interested here in physical mechanisms of control, not only in
their more ephemeral ideological justifications.

In trying to reconcile the NEA's dour prognoses with broad theoretical models
and demographic trends that reflect a proliferation of textual material, I am
confronted with two possible explanations. The writers of the report hint at
the first themselves: treating the ebb of literary reading (in a particular
mode) as cause and symptom for the general decline of the arts (and perhaps of
civilization itself). I find that reading unacceptable, (a) because it is
depressing and (b) because it smacks of historical exceptionalism. I strongly
suspect that humanity's potential for innovation and creativity has remained
relatively stable throughout history. The literary ecosystem is as vibrant and
as diverse as ever. Material conditions for creative expression change (as in
times of political oppression, pestilence, or war), where the spirit endures.

The second, much more palatable (and likely) explanation would question the
very definitions of literary reading. Consider the possibility of online or
digital literature that evolves according to a logic of its own, where previous
ideas of "genre" or "literary movements" no longer apply. To restrict literary
reading to "novels, short stories, plays, and poetry" (as is done in the NEA
report) is to deny some measure of literariness to song-writing, computer
game-making, software design, and, in an obvious way, to non-fiction or, let's
say, to essays of arbitrary length. Imagine, for example, excluding reality
television from the survey on television habits, because the genre does not
conform to some normative sense of what television should be. Do the literary
survey-makers consider literature as a medium, like television, or a grab-bag
of "serious genres" like comedy and drama? As it turns out: both. The authors
concede the point in sometimes classifying readers by the number of books read
in any genre, effectively equating literature with "books" [@nea_reading_2004].
But even that concession confuses form with function. What if "reading a book"
begins to involve something other than moving one's eyes from left to right
over sequentially numbered blocks of text? Or what if books were more like
pills, or prosthetics, than parchment? The conundrum reveals a strong
methodological bias favoring historically contingent (and likely modernist)
conceptions of the literary. A report that initially looks like objective,
quantitative, descriptive analysis (that's the way things are) hides a
qualitative, proscriptive program (that's the way they should be).

[^ln2-engell]: See also @engell_teaching_1988.

Starting with the late 1960s, a generation of scholars (Northrup Frye, Murray
Krieger, and E. D. Hirsch, among others) took up the problem of value in
literary criticism in a concerted fashion. Their conversation splintered into
three camps: the separatists---those who viewed the production of value as a
detriment to the discipline; the inseparatists (to coin a term)---those who
believed that value creation is inseparable from the study of literature; and
the compatibilists, or those who attempted to integrate the two opposing
positions. Frye, for one, argued that value production should not be a part of
the scholar's task, because the concept of value itself is "individual,
unpredictable, variable, incommunicable, indemonstrable, and mainly an
intuitive reaction to knowledge." "The more consistently one conceives of
criticism as the pursuit of values," wrote Frye, "the more firmly one becomes
attached to that great sect of anti-intellectualism" [@frye_value_1968, 317].
Ever the dry wit, Frye wrote that one can pursue a sense of value no more than
one can pursue a sense of happiness. Values, like happiness, are not end-goals
in themselves, but rather "emotional reaction[s] to activity" and a "feeling
we get from pursuing something else" [@frye_value_1968, 311].

To this Murray Krieger responded by pointing out the inevitability of value
formation in the work of even the most analytically inclined critic. Krieger
writes: "The categories [of the literary, the poetic] define their subject and
erect value criteria for admission, so that for the work to attain the
definition is for it to qualify as a valued individual in a valued class. The
work comes to be discovered, defined, and valued as poetry only by way of a
preexisting generic characteristic which the critic began by adopting as his
perspective glass to envision it [foobar sense]." All this just to say that
even for scholars like Frye, the process of valuation happens before the
encounter with the text. In designating the poem as a poem, the critic already
has brought with her a set of preconceived notions that distinguish what
constitutes poetry, and what does not; who is in and who is out. From this
viewpoint, abjuring the task of explicit value formation borders on the
irresponsible.

Critics like E. D. Hirsch offered a compromise between these two positions,
arguing that although value-making contaminates all acts of interpretation, the
scholar can and should adopt an interrogatory stance towards value creation as
such, which ultimately allows her to "form new judgments of value and
significance" [@hirsch_literary_1968, 331]. In this camp we also find
"Contingencies of Value," by Barbara Herrnstein Smith, published in 1983. At
the time, Smith urged her peers to make the examination of social
value-creating mechanisms a part of their academic discipline. "What are
commonly taken to be *signs* of literary value, are also its *springs*," Smith
writes [@smith_contingencies_1983, 30]. And the springs unmistakably push the
whole enterprise towards the Western, economically privileged model of the
canon. Texts that persist in the teaching and the selling of literature survive
as long as they do not radically subvert the prevailing ideology. Smith stops
short of offering a way out. For even as the canon grows to include previously
excluded voices, those voices take on the shape of soft acquiescence. The
custodians of the Western canon "cannot grasp or acknowledge" that alternative
forms of literariness and textuality can take on the functions of Dante or
Homer for others [@hirsch_literary_1968, 1-35]. I am appropriately galvanized
by Smith's fiery rhetoric, but must admit that not much has changed since the
1980s. Her compromise simply does not approach the very peculiarity of the
question itself. Must we value the object of our study?

To understand the peculiarity of the question, try asking: Does an
anthropologist observing cock fighting, condone animal cruelty? Does a
historian writing about war, sanction violence? Does a philosopher working on
the problem of other minds, love solipsism? In each case, synonyms for
value-making---loving, sanctioning, condoning---appear out of place,
incongruent with the inquiry at hand. Something is rotten in the very
formulation of the query. To put it differently: Must we study *only* what we
value? I cannot think of a way to defend the answer to the affirmative. A
zoology that singularly insists on the study of beautiful animals is itself a
strange creature.[^ln2-zoo] A more radical compromise compels us to seek value
in the importance of the inquiry itself: in the quality of the questions
raised, and in the relevance of the answers given. If literary reading of a
certain kind has the power ascribed to it by the NEA report (increased civic
participation, etc.), literary humanities need not concern themselves with the
protection of the literary. The survival of the field depends on the freedom of
its cadres to pursue the literary function everywhere, indiscriminately. A more
neutral and broad consideration of literary domain can include and preserve all
extant forms of textuality.

[^ln2-zoo]: There are several studies that explore
the effect of perceived aesthetics on zoology and conservation. See esp.
@stokes_things_2007; @frynta_are_2009. The short of it: cute animals get more
funding.

I am trying to burrow (impatiently, because the archive is thick, and the
bedrock far) from a big idea, like literature, down to its more modest textual
forms, and into the material substratum underlying all print media---paper,
digital, or otherwise. For this, I will need an operational definition of
literature, free (to the extent it is possible) from its normative spectres:
something like "systemic application of textuality to human life," and
textuality as "the site of literary activity." But I am not yet ready to move
beyond the obvious tautology.

### 0.7 Scale

Technological systems that give rise to complex social phenomena, from market
trading to literary canon formation, defy holistic comprehension. Writing in
1977, Langdon Winner warned the scholar of science and technology to stay away
from those "mystics" and "crackpots" who offer visions of a new and totalizing
synthesis. Quoting the French poet and philosopher Paul Valéry, he wrote that
"our means of investigation and action have far outstripped our means of
representation and understanding" [@valery_collected_1962, 69;
@winner_autonomous_1978, 290]. "Citizens of the modern age in this respect are
less fortunate than children," he wrote. Children graduate from ignorance to
understanding. Adults however never escape a "fundamental bewilderment in the
face of the complex world that their senses report." Winners work anticipates
the exponential growth in complexity of computing systems that surround us
today. The Unix operating system announced on the pages of the Proceedings of
the fourth ACM symposium on Operating systems in 1972 comprised roughly 10,000
lines of code, or roughly the equivalent of three of Shakespeare's plays
[@ritchie_unix_1973; @ritchie_unix_1974; @mccandless_million_2015]. By
contrast, the code that runs *Google* comprises more than 2 billion lines of
code, or roughly 700 million *Hamlets*.[^ln-twobil]

The growth of the literary sphere has mirrored the rapid proliferation of
code. On an average day in 2008, at home, an average American read around
100,000 words [@bohn_how_2009]. At 250 words per page, that amounts to reading
around 402 printed pages or roughly a novel like Emily Bronte's *Wuthering
Heights* per day. Pointing to the sheer impossibility of processing the amount
of published information in nineteenth let alone the twenty-first century, the
American poet and critic Craig Dworkin urged his peers to abandon the dream of
comprehensive knowledge of the literary sphere altogether
[@dworkin_seja_2008]. But does this mean we should stop trying to read or
compose literary histories?

We have two viable options, as I see it. The first is to scale up. The various
practices of distant reading arise from the condition in which canons are no
longer accessible, in their entirety, to the unaided (natural) human
intellect. The second options is to scale down. Thus where distant reading
perceives patterns across large-scale corpora, computational
hermeneutics---microanalysis---breaks literary systems down to their minute
constituent components. The best we can do in the face of complexity, Winner
advises, "is to master a few things in the immediate environment"
[@winner_autonomous_1978, 286]. Microanalysis aims to create localized pockets
of clarity from which further critique and exploration can advance.

To understand something small about the physical realities of "turning"
virtual "pages" is to create a space capable of supporting a measure of
agency, desire, or dissent.[^ln-dissent]

, Microanalysis creating pockets of clarity from
which further critique and exploration can advance. 

Between the years of 1980 and 2008, the consumption of
information in bytes---a measure that would obviously privilege storage-heavy
content like sound and video---grew at a modest 5.4 percent per year. Reading,
in decline until the advent of the internet, has tripled in the same period.
Reading in print accounted for 26 percent of verbal information consumed in
1960. That number fell to 9 percent in 2008, but the consumption of words
digitally increased to 27 percent of total consumption, which means that
reading has increased its share of the overall household attention span
[@hilbert_worlds_2011; @hilbert_info_2012]. The first decade of the
twenty-first century saw a 20 percent increase in library visitation
[@u.s._institute_of_museum_and_library_services_public_2010]. By a
conservative estimate, the number of scientific publications grows at about
4.7 percent per year, which means that the amount of published research
doubles roughly every 15 years [@archambault_welcome_2005;
@crespi_empirical_2008; @larsen_rate_2010]. The number of books published in
the United States nearly tripled from 2005 to 2009. More that 37,000 poetry
and drama titles were published in the United States between 1993 and 2006
[@dworkin_seja_2008; @bowker_u.s._2009]. All of the metrics point to an
unprecedented growth of the literary sphere.  The proliferation of code, also
read and written by humans, further contributes to the expansion of the
archive. Code produces text. It is likely that at some point soon the writing
by machines---like social media bots, spam and automatic news
generators---will outpace human literary output.[^ln-spam]

Unassisted strategies of interpretation like
philology or close reading evolved in an environment of received literary
canons, naturally accessible to the human intellect. In the age of print, a
well-educated person might have been expected to read some several hundred
"great books," which made up the "canon." Literary criticism was honed to
operate on that naturalized scale.

 These
include distant reading and macroanalysis in literary studies
[@jockers_macroanalysis_2013; @moretti_distant_2013], culturomics in economy
[@aiden_uncharted:_2014], e-discovery in law [@scheindlin_electronic_2004;
@scheindlin_electronic_2009], automatic essay evaluation in education
[@shermis_handbook_2013], and medical informatics in medicine
[@shortliffe_biomedical_2013], among others. A shared toolkit lies at the
foundations of these nascent disciplines. It includes tools like statistical
natural language processing [@manning_foundations_1999;
@jurafsky_speech_2008], automatic summarization [@radev_centroid-based_2004;
@nenkova_pyramid_2007], machine learning [@rasmussen_gaussian_2006;
@flach_machine_2012], network analysis [@opsahl_node_2010;
@szell_measuring_2010; @takhteyev_geography_2012], and topic modeling
[@wallach_topic_2006; @blei_probabilistic_2012].

The engines of search and recommendation rise to answer the needs for more
efficient filtration of data. Where a librarian or a book reviewer could sift
through thousands of volumes to distill the ones worth reading or purchasing,
the algorithmically-augmented search and discovery tool indexes billions.
Consider the task of finding an unknown (to me) factoid online, about
philosophy in the times of Andalusian Spain, for example. Where in the past I
might have started with a library subject catalog, today I construct a search
query, using resources that I believe contain a reasonably complete archive of
texts on the subject. The search engine in effect replace (or rather
complement) centuries-long processes of canon-formation. A near-instantaneous
list of query results now becomes my ephemeral, but nevertheless
authoritative, collection of literature relevant to any given topic of
interest. In this way the search engine supplants the catalog. And the
recommendation engine, of the kind commonly used by online book stores,
supplants the function of the book review.[^ln-bookreview] But as Frank
Pasquale has argued convincingly in his recent book, the problem with such
complex algorithmically-powered tools is that unlike public library catalogs,
proprietary search and recommendation engines are not necessarily open to
interpretation [@pasquale_black_2015]. They are under no obligation to reveal
their biases or motivations. The search results for "Andalusian Spain" may
well suppress elements of Muslim history or privilege a historical narrative
that privileges an English-centric view of the world.

Each text in the returned search results list requires the instrumentation of
close, analytical interpretation. However, the same discipline of critical and
reflective deliberation exercised on the level of an individual text needs to
also be exercised on the level of procedurally generated search engine
results: Where to search? Using what engine? How to construct the query? What
are the implicit biases of the system?  Whatever ideals motivate close reading
between "text" and "work" surely must drive the process on the level of
dynamic corpus composition. To make them available for scrutiny the
"macroscopes" themselves need to be taken apart. Thus where distant reading
perceives patterns across large-scale corpora, computational
hermeneutics---microanalysis---breaks literary systems down to their minute
constituent components.

Where distant reading and macroanalysis constitute the study of mediation
between readers and text aggregates (like canons, corpora, collections,
libraries, archives, and database) microanalysis examines mediation at the
level of physical minutiae otherwise not readily observed in cursory
exploration. The instruments of microanalysis may coincide with computational
tools, designed to find hidden patterns lurking above or beneath a given
document.[^ln-iarkho] The micro-instrumentation might also include a
screwdriver, a binding needle, or a soldering iron: sharp tools that help to
pry open and to scrutinize otherwise magical textual black boxes. My
methodology thus lies in the dialectical tension between making known and
making strange. Each chapter reveals the material realities of symbolic action
like "closing windows," "bookmarking a page," and "dragging and dropping
files." Where the metaphor is made strange, the mechanics of the device comes
into view. The metaphor and the machine help organize the book and each of its
chapters.


### "reading" from the perspective of a copy machine

I want to foreshadow now what
will become the punchline of the whole book: namely that the ghost in the
machine cannot be reduced to some vague notions of value---these amount to a
distraction, which lies plainly upon the surface. The conspicuous ghostly
apparition (indicating the absence of a living subject) is agency itself,
which, for now, necrotically attaches itself to dead things like systems,
mediums, and automated discourses. If all this talk of value, ghosts, and
necromancy sounds familiar, the reader will not be surprised when I advance
Karl Marx as a preeminent theorist of the algorithm and someone able to help us
reason through Kittler's computational conundrum. On towards Marx then (who
will appear much later), through the machine that, although intimately familiar
to every writer and consumer of text by touch, remains alien and alienating in
its hidden possibilities, soothing and threatening all at once.  

We often think of literary works as completed products. *To the Lighthouse,*
*Hamlet,* *Moby Dick* seem to circulate as complete, fixed entities. Textual
critics, in charge of creating a work out of a multiplicity of texts, remind us
that the work is a carefully-crafted illusion. The text multiplies, always
threatening to undermine the unity of the work. Think of something substantial
you have written recently: a paper or a proposal perhaps.

"Computer assisted tracing of text evolution"

Goodman's "Art and Authenticity." Benjamin. Immanence and transcendence.
Goodman: thinking about the perfect copy. But there is a confusion here: fake
art is not necessarily about a copy, it is about provenance. Autographic vs.
allographic art. Whether forgery is possible. Digital vs. analog art. Analog
art is medium bound. Digital abstracts from the material.

Duplicates in Computer Science. Almost 30% of webpages are "very similar to
other pages" [@fetterly_evolution_2003].

It is a commonplace sentiment now that the printing press brought with it the
Protestant Reformation [@dittmar_information_2011, @febvre_coming_2010,
@mcluhan_gutenberg_1962, @eisenberg_word_1992]. Movable type is responsible for
at least a part of that story. The mechanization of print is what turned
writing from an autographic into a supremely allographic art. The Gutenberg
press helped place a copy of the bible into the hands of every ordinary
believer. That meant also minimizing the role of the priest as a privileged
interpreter. Without books in hand Martin Luther could not have written "all
who are in the church are priests" [@hillerbrand_protestant_2009]. Movable type
lifted text from rarefied media of parchment into that of the reified and
disposable leaflet. But until well into the middle of the 20th century, the
printing press remained in the realm of big technology: expensive, centralized,
unwieldy, and relatively easy to suppress. The liberatory potential of media
independence comes into its full fruition after the age of the typewriter.
After a historically brief flowering in the wild, our daily textual practice is
once again in danger of returning to controlled, media-bound, and
tightly-regulated conditions of existence.

Several important developments in the twentieth century aided in the liberation
of text from its material contexts. The first is the copy machine.  It is an
entirely unglamorous job to ponder the phenomenology of reading from the point
of view of a photocopier. Yet the impact of the humble Ditto and Xerox machines
has only recently began to get the scholarly attention it deserves. In the
United States, the copy machine placed a smaller version of Gutenberg press
into every office. And it allowed for the flourishing of a vibrant samizdat
(self-publishing) scene, usually connected to underground culture movements
without access to conventional publishing: punks, skinheads, computer- and
game- geeks, feminists, fans of science fiction and queer-core music
[@klanten_behind_2011, @piepmeier_girl_2009, @duncombe_notes_2008].

The word "xerox" firmly entered the English lexicon by the
mid-1960s[^ln11-xerox] along with stencil duplicators, mimeograph machines,
microfiche, spirit duplicators,[^ln11-spirit] hectographs, and dot-matrix
printing. A whole industry of photocopying still exists to seamlessly peel the
content away from one material medium and plaster it into another.

From the "point of view" of a photocopier, the text exists only as pure form.
The electro-photographic process at the basis of modern photocopying (invented
in the 1930s, but with patents dating back to the middle of the 19th century)
describes documents in terms of "electric charge patterns," "photoemissive
layers," and "sheet surfaces"  [@carlson_electron_1940,
@carlson_electrophotography_1942, @carlson_graphic_1953]. The photocopier is a
device for total graphesis and extreme surface reading.[^ln11-ooo]. There is no
word or content for the photocopier: only paper and image. The photocopier's
"job", if you will, is to lift a picture from one page and to impress it into
another. It does so by temporarily imaging text (as picture) onto a
photo-sensitive drum. Ink powder sticks to the electrically charged surfaces of
the drum in correspondence to the shapes on the page. The shapes are then
rolled onto a new page, re-inscribing the image into the new medium. The text
is never immaterial. But for a moment it finds shape as an invisible electric
charge. The transformation should not be reduced to some sort of mystical,
metaphysical moment. On the contrary, in instrumental terms we observe the
relatively mundane process of media independence.

Let's linger on that moment of remediation. The process of textual
transcription by hand involves a similar transformation. When a scribe copies a
page from the bible, for example, he also "lifts" content from paper.  Not
unlike a photocopier, the human stores text in the electro-chemical pathways of
the brain, before reproducing it once again into another medium. And like a
photocopier, the human can perform the copy function mechanically, without
comprehension and on a purely formal, visual level. In fact, the historical
record is full of errors that suggest that pre-modern scribes wrote at widely
varying levels of literacy [@goudsmit_illiterate_1974,
@bucking_training_2007].[^ln11-literacy] In the Muslim tradition, the prophet
Muhammad himself is sometimes called "the unlettered prophet," to emphasize
fidelity and lack of mediation in the transcription of the message
[@calder_ummi_1990, @gunther_muhammad_2002, 1-26]. In other words, the Qur'an
claim to authenticity relies on the prophet's ability to copy the message
"verbatim." On the conservative Muslim view, anything but a faithful
transcription of the original text amounts to an interpretation, not
self-identical to the letter of the text (a translation, for example)
[@tibawi_is_1962, @fatani_translation_2005, @wilson_first_2009].[^ln11-quran]

Where the photocopier placed a printing press into every office, the printer
placed one on every desk. Falling cost of print.

Finally, the text exists on the screen and magnetic media only, where the cost
of reproduction approaches zero.

### Authorship function

The telegraph further weakens the
authorial function in transposing writing from its immediate physical
environment across vast geographical distances. The advent of telecommunication
lengthens the chain of technological mediation between author and reader. In
the absence of the identifying "hand," the telegraph clerk's and the censor's
mark cannot be distinguished from the author's (a common literary plot device
in the fiction of the period). The notion of a telegram's "fidelity" therefore
becomes an attribute of the communication channel as a whole (instead of an
attribute attached to authorial intent).

### the crisis of authenticity

It is quite odd, if you think about it, to believe that objects somehow retain
an aura or a trace of their history: "a handkerchief used by Princess Diana,"
or "the cigar box owned by President Kennedy." In some real sense, the
historical patina covering these objects is only imagined. President Kennedy's
fingerprints and the tears of Princess Diana have long disappeared from their
physical medium. Their trace cannot be reduced to "mere" physical
characteristics: that is, to actual scratches, stains, or molecules,
recoverable from the object. Rather, the object had to "be there" in some way,
acquiring a patina of authenticity. "Having been there" is what gives the
object value, sentimental or otherwise, in a condition that refuses formal
reduction to a set of merely material properties. The high price contemporary
society places on authentic artifacts is therefore a type of magical thinking.
Walter Benjamin's famous essay on the work of art in the age of mechanical
reproduction appears to both celebrate and lament the demise of such magic.
"The technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain
of tradition," wrote Benjamin. "By making many reproductions it substitutes a
plurality of copies for a unique existence. And in permitting the reproduction
to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it
reactivates the object reproduced. These two processes lead to a tremendous
shattering of tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and
renewal of mankind" [@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. And yet, for Benjamin, the
easy reproducibility of modern art forms like film and photography also
"emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual"
[@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. One could read Benjamin's famous essay as a
piece of technological nostalgia, or as an expose on the magic and superstition
latent in modernist art. Crisis or emancipation? Benjamin feels both, and in
doing so he captures the metaphysical anxiety of the modern age. We desire for
our Vermeers to stay special but also for a Vermeer to hang in every home,
peering back at us from a multitude of anonymous reproductions.

The modern world faces the challenge of authenticity, which we have only began
to assimilate: politically, economically, and philosophically. The ubiquitous
holographic certificate of authenticity on a luxury handbag or on a "Digital
Versatile Disk" (how antiquated the DVD sounds already!) is a cheap band-aid
hiding the immaterial nature of these artifacts. Fashion and software companies
are reluctant to talk publicly about piracy,[^ln11-counter] because the so
called "knock-offs" are essentially exact duplicates, often "leaked" from the
very same factories producing the original.

Note that it makes no sense to talk about "what was meant" by the designer of
the handbag, the way textual critic may talk about authorial intention. Nor
would it make sense to "correct" some perceived flaw in the painting by
Vermeer. The practice parallel to "textual criticism" in visual arts is
restoration. Although similar to textual criticism in its aims to recover some
notion of the original, crucially, the practice of art restoration takes place
without reproduction. Unlike a critical volume, which essentially reprints the
work in its reconstructed entirety, restoration happens at the site. All
"unauthorized" copies constitute a forgery that competes for attention with the
original. One could say that for painting and handbags "matter is synonymous
with meaning," but the sentiment strains at the limits of critical vocabulary
in the tradition that gives us only the binaries of form and content.

The context-dependence of an artifact is not even medium-specific, as
Goodman would suggest. Texts are more allographic than handbags and paintings,
but Vermeers and Louis Vuitton purses are also in some sense perfectly
reproducible, like texts. They are texts, and I do not mean it in some
post-structuralist notion of "everything is a text."[^ln11-derrida]

Technologies like 3D scanning and printing increasingly reduce physical objects
to their textual representation, as is the case with the stereo lithographic
document (STL) format that describes objects for 3D printing.  Here, for
example, I reproduce code that describes "a surface" of a functional gun (the
code made available online by *Defense Distributed*, a self-described civic
liberty activist group):

```
22=(
BOUNDED_SURFACE()
B_SPLINE_SURFACE(1,2,((#34104,#34105,#34106),(#34107,#34108,#34109)),
 .UNSPECIFIED.,.F.,.F.,.F.)
B_SPLINE_SURFACE_WITH_KNOTS((2,2),(3,3),(15.1641909236141,15.3257778193699),
(2.99329024107099,3.14159265358979),.UNSPECIFIED.)

RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_SURFACE(((1.,0.997252058758362,1.),(1.,0.997252058758362,
1.)))
REPRESENTATION_ITEM('')
SURFACE()
);
```

This piece of code exists in its Platonic ideal *before* the physical artifact.
As costs of reproduction approach zero, so does the line between an object and
its description. Imagine a world where to think "gun" is also to seamlessly
bring one into existence. The erosion of boundaries between object and idea has
a pronounced effect on the governance of goods, felt precisely at the
distinction between the autographic and the allographic. Governments currently
regulate the manufacture and the distribution of guns as artifacts, but how
does one regulate guns as texts and ideas? Any such effort amounts to
censorship. What was first regulated under the regime of property law, now
increasingly falls under the regimes of intellectual property and rights to
speech. Where does that leave the practice of textual criticism? In such a
world there can be no distinction between works and texts. Unlike millions of
reproduced Vermeers (which no doubt occupy this world in the form of postcards,
posters, and photographs), text is text. It lies before us in glorious
flatness, as thick as a sheet of paper.

Text as I have already began to define it Chapter One, is a digital mode of
representation, defined, at least in part, by a relative lack of "stickiness"
to its physical medium. Textual artifacts therefore exhibit the dualism between
text and work to a much greater extent than other forms of art and
communication. A Vermeer is always a work. Not so with *Hamlet*. "Hamlet" may
indicate a category of relate, or, an individual instance of a given work.
Philosophers Nelson Goodman and Catherine Elgin explain this peculiarity by
making the distinction between "works of art whose identity depends on their
history of production" and works whose identity does not. The former they call
"autographic" and the latter "allographic" [@goodman_reconceptions_1988, 65].
These terms will be useful for us throughout the book. Architecture and
painting, in this view, are strongly autographic disciplines. An exact copy of
a Vermeer or of a building by Frank Lloyd Wright could never rise to the status
of the original. The originals have what Walter Benjamin called an "aura or
authenticity." No amount of precision, down to the molecular level, could
substitute for the historical patina of the original artifact.

### 5.4 Problem of Drafts

Text as vector. Barthes: text as "an organism which grows by vital
expansion"[@barthes_work_1978, 161].  "The metaphor of the Text is that of the
*network*" [@barthes_work_1978, 161].

Internet is not rhyzomatic. Mediation is at stake. " But the bottom line is
that dumb-pipe email is unmediated, and therefore it's a business that Google
wants to get out of as soon as it can."

" It's also why I believe Google will kill Gmail as soon as it comes up with a
mediated alternative everyone loves. Of course, Google may offer an antiquated
"Gmail view" as a semi-obscure alternative to the default "Inbox"-like mediated
experience."

Science lecture vs. humanities. Stuff that is known. Stuff that is not known

What does it really mean to "know" something? Or to have "read" a book? I have
had the following conversation countless times. Someone asks, "Have you read
Nabokov's *Pale Fire*," and I respond, "Yes I have." But there is a world of a
difference between reading it yesterday, last week, or ten years ago. The book
as an interface leaves an organic trace in the human mind---an imprint that
begins to fade as soon as it is created.

How much knowledge is there in the world? According to a recent paper published
in Science, 295 exabytes (or billion gigabytes).[@hilbert_info_2012;]

Whatever consciousness is, it is propelled forward on a thin edge of material
substratum. Reality exists only in the now, where the past is a memory and the
future only a possibility. Imagine whispering something to a friend. It does
not have to be very complicated, something like "I love you" or "I miss you."
The whisper dissipates as soon it is uttered. The percussion of the speaker's
breath creates temporary order: giving shape and pushing air molecules into
waves of pattern and form. That order begins dissipating as soon as it is
created. Within milliseconds, molecules return to their natural state of chaos.

To steel ourselves against entropy, we change the substratum from air to stone.
It's molecules are more stable. Etched in stone will be the same message. It
will last longer now. But it will also take longer to create. You will have to
carry around your tablet and chisel. The message etched in stone will outlive
the whisper and indeed will

### 5.1 The Human Assumption (Heidegger + marx)

I can only begin to work of re-inscribing the A more careful analysis of
"microscopically written inscriptions" [@kittler_there_1995] in the in the
passage between typewriters and personal computers, reveals plenty of space for
human agency. Media determine our situation only to the extent that we continue
to treat the everyday transformation of thought into pixel (and thereto into
literary control systems that structure human experience) as mystical and
mystifying black-box mechanism.

Engineer vs. brick levi strauss?

Derrida calls Marx "first thinkers of technics, or even, by far and from afar,
of the tele-technology [@derrida_specters_2006, 213].

Let me make my intentions visa vis Marx perfectly clear. I have no interest in
mobilizing the entire weight of Marxist critique. A whole subset of Marxist
terminology (dictatorship, proletariat, capital) falls outside of my purview
here. Rather, I would like to co-opt Marx's discussion on the fetishism of
commodities and import it, wholesale, to the conversation on algorithms. My
interest lies in the humanism of Marx, whose thought, despite being perpetually
out of time, continues to surprise with penetrating insight.

"All these software mutations and 'new species' of software techniques are
social in a sense that they don't simply come from individual minds or from
some 'essential' properties of a digital computer or network. They come from
software developed by groups of people and marketed to large number of
users"[@manovich_there_2011, 272-273].

What is a well-formed thought? Is being able to communicate one's reasoning
clearly an integral part of clear reasoning? Can one think well, but write
poorly? Or does thinking well in a sense also mean writing well? I don't mean
to ask these questions to start an argument about cognition or rhetoric.
Rather, I would appeal to the intuitive sense of connection between the written
and the mental worlds and to simply note the natural correspondence between the
two. There is a bit of magic in that correspondence—the kind of magic that
becomes transparent (and disappears from view) through acclimation. Here is a
simple to-do list from my partner. For some moments after reading it, her will
has become my command. My arms and legs move under the spell of her bidding.
For her part, she has ensured that the list reflects what she wants me to do.
That is, it reflects what she wants. And in her absence, the to-do list did
represent her volition accurately. I read it as a testament to her will; I was
able to internalize the instructions; and then I acted on their behalf. We may
say that the to-do list was used to synchronize an aspect of our mental lives.
It was an interface of sorts, which has allowed us to bridge two separate
mental worlds, mediated by a piece of paper. And yet how quickly we discard it!
The interface itself is perhaps too thin and transparent to hold our (critical)
attention.

and the program with which most user time is spent. Accordingly, an editor has

It may seem at first a bit odd to put the words "style" and "cognition" in the
same sentence, but the concept of "cognitive style" is well-articulated in the
scientific literature on the psychology of personality. The idea of cognitive
stylistics was developed first by the American followers of Carl Jung, who like
Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers (of the still
ubiquitous Myers-Briggs Type Indicator offered by career placement centers
across the country) were interested in applying insights from
quantitatively-based psychological observation (psychometrics) to problems of
labor and education. In the early 1950s, the idea of "personality type" gave
way to "cognitive style" in the work of psychologists George Klein, Philip
Holzman, Riley Gardner, and Herbert Schlesinger.1 For this new generation of
scholars, the concept meant something like "the individual differences in
adaptive modes of organizing and experiencing the stimulus world."2 That is to
say that people simply have or develop a preference for a particular mode of
thinking about and perceiving the world. Or even simpler: "everyone does it in
his own way."3 Thus, in an early experiment Gardner observes a group of people
categorizing objects by size, shape, and color. Predictably, different people
perceive the differences between size, shape, and color in differing
gradations.4 The converse of this experiment suggests also that certain modes
of material organization favor a particular style of thought. We may assume,
for example, that certain ways of organizing the world attract or "make sense"
to a particular type of person. In the literature on education, the concept is
therefore popular within the discussion of learning styles, by which teachers
are encouraged to present their material in ways accessible to students with
varying preferences for visual, auditory, tactile, or kinesthetic learning.

The hypothesis of cognitive styles underlies a particular belief about the
connection between mental organization and the organization of objects in the
real world. It is what Heidegger called "the correlation between being, word,
gathering, hand, and writing"5 and perhaps what Nietzsche meant when he wrote
that "our writing tools are also working on our thoughts."6 Heidegger in
particular is often cited in this regard. In his meditation on Parmenides,
delivered as a series of lectures during the war at the University of Freiburg,
Heidegger is clearly bothered by what he perceives as the "irruption of the
typewriter into the realm of the world of handwriting."7 Ever in search of
essences, he imagines hand-writing to possess a special kind of magic, denoting
"an original essential nexus, to which the indicating writing-hand belongs." He
continues to say that: [...] in handwriting the relation of Being to man,
namely the word, is inscribed in beings themselves. The origin and the way of
dealing with writing is already in itself a decision about the relation of
Being and of the word to man and consequently a decision about the comportment
of man to beings and about the way both, man and thing, stand in
unconcealedness or are withdrawn from it.8

The typewriter somehow disturbs this idyllic picture, withdrawing "from man the
essential rank of the hand, without man's experiencing this withdrawal
appropriately and recognizing that it has transformed the relation of Being to
his essence."9 In my favorite bit of condescension from the old master,
Heidegger goes as far as to suggest that his readers misunderstand him
precisely because type-setting is so groundless. "The typewriter is a signless
cloud," he writes, "a withdrawing concealment in the midst of its very
obtrusiveness […] not showing itself to its essence." "Perhaps that is why most
of you, as is proven to me by your reaction, though well-intended, have not
grasped what I have been trying to say."10

What is Heidegger trying to say here? And what precisely is being concealed by
the typewriter? In "The Question Concerning Technology," originally published
in 1954, Heidegger explains that technology is primarily a mode of revealing
truth. To make this point, Heidegger begins with an analysis of a specific
artifact—a silver chalice used for ceremonial rights. Initially, it seems that
the primary purpose of the artifact is to facilitate something, the
administration of ceremonial rites in this case. The cup is an instrument for
something, in other words; it is a means to an end. Another way to put it would
be to say that the ceremony is the cause for the cup's very existence. But
there is more than just causa finalis, as Heidegger puts it. The physical
properties of silver (causa materialis) also constitute a cause, as does the
shape of the cup (causa formalis), and as does the silversmith who has
fashioned the vessel (the silversmith being causa efficiens). In fact the cup's
very instrumentality is grounded in this chain of causation. The cup is an
occasion to bring forth the ceremony; to bring forth a certain property of
silver; to bring forth the water-containing property of the vessel's shape; and
finally to bring forth the craft of the silversmith. The making of the cup is
not mere "handicraft manufacture," Heidegger writes, nor is it "only artistic
and poetical bringing into appearance and concrete imagery," but rather a
"bringing-forth, "poiesis in the highest sense."11

At its best, technology reveals truth. At this point of the essay Heidegger
makes a distinction between traditional technology or "handicraft," and modern,
machine-powered technology.12 Modern technology also reveals, writes Heidegger.
But it does not "unfold into a bringing-forth in the sense of poiesis." Rather
modern technology is a challenge or a provocation [Herausfordern] to nature.
The figure of the natural betrays the extent of Heidegger's romanticism. "The
revealing that is modern technology is a challenging, which puts to nature the
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as
such," writes Heidegger.13 "But does it hold true for the old windmill as
well?" he asks. And answers, No. Its sails do indeed turn in the wind; they are
left entirely to the wind's blowing. But the windmill does not unlock energy
from the air currents in order to store it. In contrast, a tract of land is
challenged in the hauling out of coal and ore. The earth now reveals itself as
a coal mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit. The field that the
peasant formerly cultivated and set in order appears different from how it did
when to set it in order still meant to take care of and to maintain. The work
of the peasant does not challenge the soil of the field. In sowing grain he
places seed in the keeping of the forces of growth and waits over its increase.
[By contrast] agriculture is now the mechanized food industry. Air is now set
upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield uranium, for
example; uranium set upon to yield atomic energy, which can be released either
for destruction or for peaceful use.14

The passage is remarkable for its apparent prescience of the contemporary
environmental conservation movement, which often implies a similar conservative
romanticism about handicraft technology. Both ideologies contain a particular
notion of "authentic" or "unadulterated" state of nature, which is
"challenged," to use Heidegger's terminology, by the tools of modern
technology. Handicraft, by contrast, is seen as an activity that operates in
harmony with nature, without undue disturbance. This view is of course
historically incorrect. Pre-modern hunting practices and agriculture have often
led to large-scale ecological disturbances: pollution, species extinction, and
deforestation. In this context, the distinction between modern and pre-modern
itself begins to seem arbitrary. The latent romantic naturalism strains under
further scrutiny. The silver chalice, for example, can be seen as the
culmination of a long and destructive process of mining, ore processing,
smelting, and manufacture, which at each stage involves the very opposite of
Heidegger's ideal non-disruptive poiesis.

A more chartable reading of the passage would attempt to place Heidegger's
critique of modern technology in the context of his phenomenology. Heidegger's
phenomenology is a weighty, but well-explored topic, and for this reason I will
limit our discussion to its most generally-known and relevant features. For
Heidegger, our knowledge of the world comes in two flavors: presentness-at-hand
[Vorhandenheit] and readiness-to-hand [Zuhandenheit]. When we think of some
object in the world—a hammer, to use the famous example—we first imagine
something like the formal definition of a hammer in a series of knowable facts
about the object: a hammer is made of metal and wood, we use it to pound nails,
it is man's first tool, and so on. The type of epistemological knowledge about
the world, the knowledge that combines the readily observable properties and
our shared understanding of the object, is called "present-to-hand" in
Heidegger's system. "Ready-to-hand" knowledge by contrast is practical. I know
something about the hammer, but I also have used a hammer—and in using it I
understood the tool in an applied manner. But more than that, in using the
hammer I understand something about the nail. An essential property of the
transition between theoretical and applied knowledge of the world, is the
disappearance of the tool. For Heidegger, the tool literally becomes a kind of
"sight," helping us identify properties of the world that are particularly
well-suited for its application. "Action has its own kind of sight," Heidegger
writes in Being and Time.15 The hammer helps us experience the nail in a
hammering kind-of-a-way. Hammering reveals something about the nail, and by
extension, about metals in general. At the bottom of this experience is man's
relationship to nature itself. All "good" technologies work in that way for
Heidegger. "Technology comes to presence in the realm where revealing an
unconcealment take place, where aletheia, truth, happens," he writes in "The
Question Concerning Technology."16 The plow reveals something about the earth,
just as the windmill reveals something about the air current.

Modern technology reveals too, but it breaks the "natural" phenomenological
experience in two important ways. First, the tool fails to fully disappear into
the experience. I imagine this to be the same kind of a feeling a musician has
when playing an unfamiliar instrument. The instrument "stands in the way" of
the unity between man and music. Second, the modern instrument introduces a
kind of a perceptual bias. It treats nature as a reserve of energy [Bestand]—as
a kind of a storehouse, an inventory, or a collection. Whereas the farmer's
plow reveals the earth as fertile ground, the tractor reveals it to be a mere
resource for mechanized agriculture. The earth ceases to be an object of
knowledge, amenable to other ways of knowing. In this way, modern technology
works to "order" or to "enframe" matter, interfering with the very process of
truth-formation. Moreover, just as the earth ceases to be the object of
knowledge, the ordering—or to use the very un-Heideggerian term, the
commodification—of natural resources threatens to turn the human into a
resource. For Heidegger, modern technology disrupts the status of the human as
a proper subject:

Only to the extent that man for his part is already challenged to exploit the
energies of nature can this revealing which orders happen. If man is
challenged, ordered, to do this, then does not man himself belong even more
originally than nature within the standing–reserve? The current talk about
human resources, about the supply of patients for a clinic, gives evidence of
this. The forester who measures the felled timber in the woods and who to all
appearances walks the forest path in the same way his grandfather did, is today
ordered by the industry that produces commercial woods, whether he knows it or
not. He is made subordinate to the orderability of cellulose, which for its
part challenged forth by the need of paper, which is then delivered to
newspapers and illustrated magazines.

The commodification of both subject and object commodifies phenomenology
itself. One can perceive more than a hint of Marx in this line of critique.  If
the plow reveals something about the earth, the pen reveals something about
language. The relationship between man and language is of a primary importance
to Heidegger. In the realm of language, man stands in relation to being itself.
Heidegger's own discourse often progresses through a series of etymological
reconstructions, which contain an almost mystical sense of reverence for the
veracity of meaning contained in the original, Greek understanding of a given
concept. By similar logic, the hand represents a "pure," unadulterated
relationship of man to language. The hand "contains an essence of the human
being because the word, as the essential region of the hand, is the essential
ground of being human."17 In the metaphoric juxtaposition between word and
ground, the analogy between pen and plow becomes apparent. And just like
mechanized agriculture, mechanized writing "deprives the hand of dignity in the
realm of the written word and degrades the word to a mere means for the traffic
of communication."18 The typewriter commodifies language in other words,
turning it into the "standing reserve" of information. "In mechanized writing
all humans begin to look the same," writes Heidegger.19 

### Intermedia as Syncopation between Human, Machine, and Language 

It has been suggested that Heidegger's distaste for mechanized writing stemmed
from his inability to type.20 Don Ihde, a contemporary authority on
Heidegger's philosophy of technology, suggests that all new mechanisms go
through an awkward stage of sorts, in which they still feel unfamiliar to us,
and therefore disruptive in the way an unfamiliar instrument is "in the way"
of music for a musician. But with time, these technologies once again become
transparent to us, and the link between man and language is once again
restored in the fluent hands of a nimble typist.21 Such an attempt to
"de-romanticize"22 Heidegger's argument cannot fully diffuse the rhetorical
force of his critique. Heidegger's romanticism continues to exert considerable
influence on contemporary thought, particularly when it comes to the
discussion about emerging technology, and especially in the fields of literary
and cultural studies. Perhaps the most visible (in a sense of well-known and
often-cited) example of this trend is Friedrich Kittler's 1986 Gramophone,
Film, Typewriter. In the conclusion of this book-length study, Kittler brings
the Heideggerian rhetoric to its natural paranoiac crescendo: "A simple
feed-back loop—and information machines bypass humans—their so-called
inventors […] Electronics, a tube monster since Bletchley Park, replaces
discourse, and programmability replaces free will […] Under the condition of
high technology, literature has nothing more to say. It ends in cryptograms
that defy interpretation and only permit interception." As evidence for this
vision, Kittler submits a letter/poem which resembles a nonsensically-encoded
communiqué addressed to Truman, Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill.23 A more
tempered position, along the same Heideggerian lines, was advanced by Erich
Kahler, a prominent American literary critic writing in the 1960s, who saw the
history of the avant-garde movements in the 20th century following a downward
trajectory of formal disintegration—from the initial purging of sentiment in
the nouveau roman, to the dissolution of language in the final "typographical
stage" of literary development.24 Kahler's ultimate worry was over what he
called "the triumph of incoherence," which leads to "the dissolution of the
linguistic form," "the divorce of language from its human source," and
finally, to the destruction of consciousness itself (when consciousness for
him is defined as coherent perception of the world25). "What started as
poetry," writes Kahler, "ends up in typography."26 "Under the fanfares of
thrilling innovations sounding everywhere, from Brazil to Iceland, literature
fades away, not only into graphics, but into motley sound associations and
mechanistic regimentation:" The overwhelming preponderance of collectivity
with its scientific, technological and economic machinery, the daily flow of
new discoveries and inventions that perpetually change aspects and habits of
thought and practice, the increasing incapacity of individual consciousness to
cope with the abstract anarchy of its environment, and its surrender to a
collective consciousness that operates anonymously and diffusely in our social
and intellectual institutions—all this has shifted the center of gravity of
our world from existential to functional, instrumental, and mechanical ways of
life. At the same time the hypertrophy of functional rationalization has
produced an overcompensating irrationality, reversing to the bodily concrete
or spiraling to the absurd. Hence the products of the avant-gardes display a
strange blend of erratic imaginative vagaries with technological and
pseudo-scientific aspirations. Fragments of unconscious and sensory experience
are in a ghostly manner treated with an exactitude derived from the rational
consciousness and information.27 

I take Kahler's reaction to concrete poetry as an eloquent, if somewhat
misguided, expansion of Heidegger's "typewriters are ruining things" thesis.
The argument is again a restatement of the connection between technology,
language, and consciousness---a triad that resurfaces every few decades as a
manifestation of our collective technophobic hypochondria.

In my understanding, the practice of concrete poetry stands in diametric
opposition to the thesis advanced by Heidegger, Kittler, and Kahler---a vision of
literary dissolution under the conditions of high technology. The artifice of
Emmett Williams's "Sometimes" (Figure 4.1) lies in the reinserting of the
writing implement into the protected world of the poetic. The poem is
impossible without the machine. Reading or reciting it is not enough: we are
meant to type, or at least to imagine typing the poem. Classical scansion is
not sufficient either. We must be able to imagine the rhythm of the typewriter:
the sharp hammer-like movement of its type-bars, the clicking of the platern,
the whizzing sound and the bell of the lever-operated carriage return. The
typewriter "thinks" in so far as it suggests a particular style—of writing,
thinking—a style that has an impetus, a logic, and a poetry of its own. The
rhythmic impetus of the typewriter pulls the poem along a particular metric
trajectory. The poet disrupts that logic with a correction. The resulting
grapheme, documents the interruption, and in the process pulls the material
world into the literary. The smudge of the ribbon, the rejected versions of the
poem, the mark of the proofreader, and yes the typewriter itself—all of these
"extra-literary" elements of the creative process are elevated to the status of
the poetic. Another way to describe the dynamic between literature and
technology in this case, would be to say that the concretist aesthetic
appropriates the extra-functional elements of the writing mechanism. What
initially seems a mere artifact of literary production becomes art. Literature
thus taints technology, stripping away the pretense of pure functionalism.
Under the condition of the literary, to reverse Kittler here, technology gains
a new voice. Nothing is determined about the encounter between human, machine,
and language. Each element of this triad contains a mere suggestion of rhythm
and pace. The resulting symphony is a syncopation of all three elements. There
is of course nothing particularly modern about his dynamic. The printing press
introduced a particular poetics into the language as well. It is just that
after a time, the cognitive style of the printing press has become transparent
to us, particularly after publishing had congealed into a relatively stable
system of production and distribution. The advent of the typewriter, of desktop
publishing, and of distributed, online models of publication destabilizes the
established stylistics. With each of these advancements we worry anew about the
impact of technology on our way of thinking—a concern that goes back to the
introduction of writing itself, as in Plato's Phaedrus.

The history of concrete poetry can be seen as the culmination of one such
shift, spurred on by the transference of type-setting from the printer to the
author. This dynamic may explain the simultaneous eruption of concrete poetry
across multiple literary traditions. "The confused geography of its beginnings
reflects the universality of its roots," Williams writes.28 He then suggests
the following signposts upon this landscape: the "constellation" poetry of
Eugene Gomerenger; the posters of Carlo Belloli and F.T. Marinetti; the
Noigandres poets of Sao Paulo; the work of the Danish poet Oyvin Fahlstrom; the
ideagrams of Dieter Roth; the sound-poetry experiments of the East German poet
Carlfriedrich Claus; the collaborative work of the Vienna composer Gerhard
Ruhm, architecht Friedrich Achleitner, a jazz musician Oswald Weiner, and the
poets H.C. Atmann and Konrad Bayer in the early fifties; and finally Williams's
own work with the Darmstadt Circle, which included the Kitasano Katue of Japan
and the German dramaturgist Claus Bremer.29 To this topography we could add an
increasingly long list of "intermedial" work by Vladimir Mayakovsky and
Guillame Apollinaire in the early 1920s, several of Lewis Carroll's poetic
experiments, and much work from non-western traditions, in alphabets that have
always contained a strong visual element (Chinese, Arabic, etc).  In this
light, concrete poetry can be seen as the culmination of a particular
techno-cognitive style—a full-blown artistic movement which peaks at the
eclipse of the typewriter age. The cognitive style of concrete poetry, if one
may speak of such a thing, is one of cross-modal perception. It literally
attempts to engage areas of the brain not normally affected by passive reading.
Artists associated with Fluxus and concrete poetry were committed to the
development of what they called intermedia. In his 1966 "Statement on
Intermedia," Dick Higgins, the Cambridge-born poet, composer, and publisher,
writes: For the last ten years or so, artists have changed their media to suit
this situation, to the point where the media have broken down in their
traditional forms, and have become merely puristic points of reference. The
idea has arisen, as if by spontaneous combustion throughout the entire world,
that these points are arbitrary and only useful as critical tools, in saying
that such-and-such a work is basically musical, but also poetry. This is the
intermedial [sic] approach, to emphasize the dialectic between the media. A
composer is a dead man unless he composes for all the media and for his
world.30 The spontaneous invention of this artistic program in Switzerland,
Italy, Argentina, Germany, and the United States31 is contemporaneous with the
turn to cross-modal perception studies in post-war psychology. At the core of
this shared program is a new understanding of cognitive stylistics. As Marshal
McLuhan, himself associated with the Fluxus movement, wrote in his 1967
Verbi-Voco-Visual Explorations, "the physics of typographic lineality have
dominated our perception."32 But, as Kahler notes in his anti-concretist
polemic, this approach has also erased the boundaries between the
socially-constructed categories that separate the literary from the visual and
auditory arts. With that expansion come the loss of specificity and the
dissolution of the protective barriers that usually separate genre and medium.
Fluxus could thus be viewed as a type of cognitive calisthenics, designed to
loosen the rigidity of fixed mental perception—a mental rigidity reinforced by
the rigidity in cultural categories (epistemology).
