jean
baudrillards
writing
on
simulacra
in
relationship
to
the
media
entertainment
complex
amusement
parks
virtual
reality
and

television
today
his
writing
gains
another
layer
of
meaning
related
directly
to
the
ubiquity
of
personal
computing
computers
as
i
will
argue
in
this
chapter
do
more
than
compute
they
are
metaphor
machines
that
mediate
experience
universally
they
interject
in
simple
everyday
acts
from
drinking
coffee
in
the
morning
through
automatic
brewing
machines
and
payment
systems
to
going
to
bed
as
alarm
clocks
and
night
activity
monitors
baudrillard
writes
about
the
genesis
of
simulacra
which
culminates
precisely
in
the
totalizing
mediation
of
code
at
the
limit
of
an
always
increasing
elimination
of
references
and
finalities
an
everincreasing
loss
of
resemblances
and
designations
we
find
the
digital
and
programmatic
sign
whose
value
is
purely
tactical
at
the
intersection
of
other
signals

whose
structure
is
that
of

of

my
concern
here
is
with
the
structure
of
code
the
programmatic
sign
which
splits
its
energies
between
the
screen
and
hard
drive
on
the
screen
at
the
site
of
projection
the
programmatic
sign
simulates
familiar
materialities

shadows

at
the
site
of
storage
from
which
the
sign
emanates

language

to
the

of

a
series
of
structural

originates

further
morphs
into
a

then

into

literary

called
such
construction
and

in
the
phatic
function
lies
the
essence
of
programming
code
shapes
and
commands
at
the
same
time
it
conjures
fantastical
metaphors
to
occlude
the
structure
of
shaping
and
commanding
simulation
obscures
the
incongruence
between
visible
representation
and
the
underlying
material
affordances
of
the
medium
what
you
see
is
not
always
what
you
get
we
are
instead
confronted
with
a
composite
image
which
under
examination
reveals
a
complex
process
of
transfiguration
between
the
visible
sign
and
the
sign
at
the
site
of
the
inscription
when
reading
online
for
example
we
observe
what
looks
like
a
book
where
we
should
also
perceive
an
attempt
to
censor
and
surveil
the
simulation
is
without
a
referent
it
bares
little
resemblance
to
the
material
substrata
of
electronic
reading
we
believe
we
are
handling
a
book
our
ideas
about
reading
and
interpretation
subsequently
rely
on
that
initial
physical
point
of
contact
with
paper
but
when
reading
electronically
we
are
handling
something
other
than
print
material
the
semblance
to
paper
guides
our
intuitions
about
the
possibilities
of
the
medium
the
ability
to
scroll
bookmark
or
turn
pages
we
have
far
fewer
intuitions
about
the
affordances
of
inscription
at
the
micromolecular
level
as
we
turn
the
page
on
the
screen
an
electric
charge
embedded
into
a
solid
state
medium
crosses
the
impenetrable
oxide
barrier
reaching
its
destination
the
floating

through
quantum
tunnelling
which
exploits
the

of

in

numerous

at

what
can
be
said
then
about
the
practices
of
reading
and
interpretation
grounded
in
such
remote
physicalities
for
now
only
that

metaphor
sustains
our
lives
in
digital
worlds
artificially
by
analogy
with
habituated
media
we
already
know
what
to
do
with
paper
the
electronic
book
therefore
replicates
paper
such
metaphors
dull
the
discomfort
at
the
point
of
contact
between
human
and
machine
they
hinder
the
effort
of
mastering
poetics
at
the
quantum
level
the
ability
to
inject
electrons
draw
lattices
manipulate
arrays
affect
solid
states
of
being
it
is
tempting
to
view
media
ecosystems
that
host
our
digital
lives
as
a
kind
of
a
natural
element
like
water
or
air
but
we
should
not
forget
also
that
computational
ecologies
are
constructed
environments
they
are
not
governed
by
the
laws
of
physics
in
the
same
sense
that
clouds
or
oceans
are
they
form
a
part
of
a
massive
tactical
effort
to
bring
private
spaces
of
inhabitancethink
the

on
your

the
purview
of
computational
control
the
simulation
encodes
political
structures
that
should
not
be
naturalized
lest
we
succumb
to
the
complacency
of
technological
determinism
our
goal
in
this
chapter
is
to
arrest
the
advance
of
the
metaphor
we
must
begin
to
separate
resemblances
from
their
designations
the
apparent
shape
from
a
command
in
the
imperative
what
does
it
mean
to
turn
a
page
in
a
medium
that
sustains
neither
turning
nor
pages
in
this
chapter
we
will
use
the
tools
of
cognitive
metaphor
theory
to
tell
the
story
of
metaphors
influence
on
computation
at
a
formative
moment
in
the
history
of
humancomputer
interaction
i
plan
to
approach
this
tradition
from
within
taking
on
its
language
and
assumptions
in
the
first
several
sections
of
the
chapter
the
latter
sections
capture
the
historical
transition
between
literal
computing
by
which
users
gave
explicit
commands
to
their
machines
and
the
socalled
direct
manipulation
model
by
which
they
began
to
occupy
virtual
figurative
environments
the
chapter
draws
on
the
archives
from
graphic
design
literary
theory
and
computer
sciencefields
that
come
into
direct
contact
in
the
1970s
1980s
and
1990s
the
trajectory
from
the
conversational
to
the
direct
model
of
humancomputer
interaction
points
to
the
speculative
possibility
of
seemingly
unmediated
coupling
between
human
and
machinea
possibility
that
i
acknowledge
and
finally
reject
outright
in
the
conclusion
of
the
chapter
the
appeal
to
immediacy
and
immersion
in
the
principles
of
direct
manipulation
conceals
the
nature
of
mediation
verisimilitude
from
the
many
available
theories
of
metaphor
in
this
chapter
i
rely
on
the
ideas
from
the
so
called
cognitive
metaphor
school
developed
extensively
by
george
lakoff
mark
johnson
and
mark
turner
among
others
in
the
1980s
as
we
shall
see
later
on
in
the
chapter
this
school
of
thought
gained
influence
in
the
formative
period
in
the
history
of
humancomputer
interaction
it
is
therefore
important
for
me
examine
the
vocabulary
of
that
tradition
on
its
own
terms
and
to
advance
its
critique
from
within
it
also
bares
mentioning
that
in
the
language
of
cognitive
metaphor
theory
all
figurative
tropes
of
comparisonhyperbole
metonymy
synecdoche
or
similefall
under
the
category
of
metaphor
to
avoid
confusions
of
the
sort
to
get
onto
the
same
page
if
you
will
i
plan
to
spend
a
few
pages
now
delving
into
the
technical
vocabulary
of
metaphor
theory
this
language
will
later
help
us
explore
the
ways
by
which
metaphors
make
and
unmake
everyday
computational
environments
of
human
habitation
i
am
interested
here
and
throughout
the
book
in
a
particular
mode
of
virtual
habitation
and
habituation
which
by
its
very
nature
begins
and
ends
with
the
technologies
of
metaphor
in
the
1980s
a
number
of
influential
publications
in
the
field
of
humancomputer
interaction
relied
on
insights
from
cognitive
metaphor
theory
to
refashion
computers
from
business
productivity
tools
into
tools
of
the
imagination
as
ultimate
metaphor
machines
in
this
light
computer
interfaces
mediate
the
transference
between
human
and
machine
at
the
liminal
space
where
two
disparate
systems
of
representation
meet
to
exchange
information

be
said
to
translate

the
language
of
computation
reveals
its
reliance
on
structural
metaphor
in
practice
consider
the
following
passage
from
a
patent
filed
by
xerox
in
1991
it
describes
in
its
own
words
an
electronic
library
metaphor
which
includes
a
shared
books
with
database
metaphor
a
reference
books
metaphor
and
a
card
catalog
metaphor
in
one
system
that
allows
large
object
oriented
data
bases
to
be
organized
and
accessed
in
an
exclusive
environment
and
in
addition
allows
access
to
screen
icons
creates
a
visual
hierarchy
of
related
and
shared
objects
and
allows
mutually
exclusive
access
to
the
metaphors
within
the

setting
aside
for
a
moment
the
peculiarity
of
being
able
to
patent
a
metaphor
note
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
technical
language
what
does
it
mean
to
access
a
metaphor
when
someone
checks
out
a
book
from
the
electronic
library
do
they
gain
access
to
the
book
or
to
the
metaphor
alone
what
mechanisms
assure
the
correspondence
between
a
database
and
database
metaphor
the
book
and
book
metaphor
and
the
catalog
and
catalog
metaphor
traditional
metaphor
theory
strains
to
answer
such
questions
in
the
socalled
classical
view
metaphors
are
simply
a
type
of
figurative
language
to
say
the
day
stands
tiptoe
on
the
misty
mountain
tops
is
to
use
the
verb
stand
in
a
novel
linguistic
context
days

no
literal
legs
to
stand
on
john
searle
george
lakoff
and
mark
turner
among
others
have
argued
that
metaphors
are
more
broadly
a
cognitive
phenomenon
mapping
distinct
ontological
categories
across
conceptual
domains
lakoffmetaphors1980
turnerdeath1987

searlemetaphor1998
in
the
modified
view
even
such
basic
semantic
concepts
as
state
quantity
action
cause
purpose
means

are
metaphorical
in
nature
lakoffmetaphorical1980

beyond
figurative
lyrical
language
lakoff
and
others
have
argued
that
metaphors
broadly
structure
everyday
experience
thus
the
analysis
of
common
phrases
like
things
are
looking
up
and
i
cant
get
that
tune
out
of
my
mind
reveals
underlying
figuration
like
good
things
are
up
and
the
mind
is
a
container
the
idea
that
good
things
are
up
generates
a
multitude
of
metaphors
like
profits
are
going
up
and
moving
on
up

example

in
the
cognitive
view
the
metaphor
performs
a
number
of
conventional
mappings
from
one
domain
to
another
lakoffcontemporary1998
239
lakoff
mentions
for
example
the
common
trope
of
a
state
is
a
person
implicit
in
the
ideas
of
friendly
and
hostile
states
lakoffcontemporary1998
243
this
metaphor
implies
that
ideas
about
agency
emotion
and
mental
life
usually
attached
to
people
can
be
extended
to
state
actors
similarly
to
say
that
someone
is
boiling
mad
instantiates
the
common
trope
of
anger
is
a
hot
liquid
in
a
container
in
this
case
common
known
properties
attached
to
the
domain
of
physics
are
mapped
onto
the
domain
of
emotion
lakoff
further
explains
that
such
domain
mappings
tend
to
follow
a
few
rules
they
are
usually
partial
and
asymmetrical
mappings
are
not
arbitrary
he
writes
but
grounded
in
the
body
and
in
everyday
experience
and
knowledge
finally
domain
mappings
obey
what
lakoff
calls
the
invariance
principle
by
which
the
image
schema
structure
of
the
source
domain
is
projected
onto
the
target
domain
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with

structural

transfer
organizing
principles
from

thus
to
say
the

is
our
oyster
is
to
suggest
that
something

the

to
the

other
the
transferred
property
implies
a
not
just
a
semantic
similarity
one
of
meaning
but
a
structural
one
one
of
interface
the
metaphor
suggests
the
world
is
arranged
like
an
oyster
somehow
that
it
can
be
cracked
and
that
it
contains
a
tasty
hidden
morsel
within
in
this
way
structural
metaphors
organize
one
thing
in
the
shape
of
another
they
are
a
tool
for
extending
insights
from
a
known
domain
to
lesser
known
one
a
tool
for
exploration
simple
things
like
oysters
shed
light
on
complex

their

present
us
with
a
special

john
carrol
one
of
the
pioneers
in
the
field
of
humancomputer
interaction
summarized
the
role
of
metaphors
in
the
design
of
computing
systems
as
follows
professional
programmers
might
learn
a
new
system
x
by
metaphorizing
at
least
initially
from
what
they
already
know
about
system
y
more
casual
or
naive
endusers
might
rely
on
metaphors
drawn
from
more
distant
knowledge
domains
eg
on
what
they
have
already
learned
about
electric
typewriters
the
implications
of
this
proposal
are
simple
and
direct
if
people
employ
metaphors
in
learning
about
computing
systems
the
designers
of
those
systems
should
anticipate
and
support
likely
metaphorical
constructions
to
increase
the
ease
of
learning
and
using
the

you

by
using

to
convey

use
metaphors
involving

familiar
ideas
and
make
the
metaphors
plain
so
that
users
have
a
set
of
expectations
to
apply
to
computer
environments
for
example
people
often
use
folders
to
store
paper
documents
in

therefore
it
makes
sense
to
people
to
store
computer
documents
in

designers
understood
that
the
mapping
of
concepts
between
the
physical
and
the
computergenerated
worlds
is
imperfect
for
example
unlike
a

file
folder
constrained
by
the

a
computer
folder
can
hold
a
nearly
unlimited
amount
of
files
or
to
be
more
precise
the
electronic
folder
metaphor
is
subject
to
different
constraints
than
those
that
limit
the
use
of
paper
files
the
image
of
a
paper
file
should
not
therefore
limit
the
possibilities
of

it
further
advises
its
readers
to
strike
a
balance
between
the

and

ability
of
the

to
support

describes
a

metaphor
that
allows
a

to
organize

in

manner
that

the

continue
to
explain
that
while
the

may
be

separate

the

provides
a

that
the

of

must
involve
the

another

can
be
found
in
the
collaboration
between
the
influential

the

describe
the

glasergraphical1995
in
these
words
we
begin
to
to
glimpse
the
trouble
with
the
structural
metaphor
paradigm
of
humaninterface
design
the
idea
of
direct
manipulation
refers
to
the
immediate
access
to
the
metaphor
that
is
paradoxically
the
appearance
of
access
without
mediationthe
occlusion
of
the
document
in
favor
of
its
representation
the
issue
of
apparent
immediacy
will
continue
to
haunt
our
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
chapter
dissimulation
readers
know
what
paragraphs
pages
files
and
folders
can
do
on
paper
and
would
like
for
digital
images
of
paper
to
behave
in
a
similar
way
the
principles
of
metaphordriven
design
contain
an
implicit
model
of
humancomputer
interaction
which
suggests
that
humans
prefer
to
manipulate
digital
information
stored
on
computational
media
by
the
means
of
familiar
mediating
structuresparagraphs
pages
files
and
foldersassociated
figuratively
with
the
affordances
of
print
media
for
example
one
affordance
of
paper
is
that
it
can
be
folded
it
therefore
becomes
possible
to
earmark
a
page
by
folding
a
corner
the
fold
enables
subsequent
recollection
of
text
that
was
read
previously
by
these
means
a
reader
marks
a
notable
place
in
the
text
in
order
to
return
to
it
later
patently
digital
media
cannot
as
of
yet
fold
by
the
way
of
paper
readers
seeking
a
mechanism
for
digital
recollection
may
not
be
familiar
with
the
affordances
of
newly
inhabited
medium
consequently
the
affordances
of
digital
media
are
presented
through
metaphor
thus
a
virtual
earmark
on
a
page
represents
a
numerical
pointer
to
a
specific
address
in
the
computer
memory
a
page
stands
for
a
range
of
related
addresses
that
correspond
roughly
to
the
information
visible
on
an
analogous
page
in
print
similarly
one
drops
a
folder
into
a
trash
bin
or
drags
and
drops
a
file
or
bookmarks
a
page
on
a
screen
such
metaphors
rely
on
habituated
insight
with
one
medium
extended
into
another
we
do
not
literally
drag
or
drop
bits
but
we
use
metaphors
of
paper
and
trashcans
to
help
us
manipulate
bits
and
bytes
as
if
they
were
household
objects
the
metaphor
opens
figurative
possibilities
it
also
obscures
the
actual
physical
contingencies
of
interacting
with
bits
and
bytes
logic
gates
and
magnetic
traces
the
affordances
of
physical
media
differ
from
those
of
the
simulated
we
handle
bits
and
bytes
differently
from
files
and
folders
pages
and
paragraphs
the
metaphorical
substitution
encourages
readers
to
extend
the
facility
they
have
with
handling
one
sort
of
media
paper
and
ink
to
another
screen
and
pixels
what
readers
gain
in
facility
they
lose
in
critical
faculty
alienated
from
the
material
conditions
of
information
storage
and
retrieval
readers
gain
access
to
the
metaphor
alone
thus
we
go
through
the
motions
of
turning
the
page
but
in
actuality
redraw
the
screen
we
highlight
a
passage
which
constitutes
an
action
that
may
also
send
information
about
the
highlighted
passage
to
a
data
aggregation
service
we
share
a
book
which
really
means
assigning
a
temporary
license
to
another
user
where
does
the
text
go
i
ask
when
downloading
a
paper
from
an
online
journal3
it
is
in
your
home
folder
someone
answers
but
unless
one
of
us
is
familiar
with
the
material
contingencies
of
file
storage
neither
has
a
mental
map
of
any
physical
location
corresponding
to
the
home
directory
same
as
folder
the
default
location
of
personal
files
on
many
systems
when
confronted
with
the
actual
affordances
of
digital
text
the
user
grasps
for
neutered
metaphors
we
reside
in
such
homes
own
share
and
create
only
in
the
simulacrum
metaphors
of
humancomputer
interaction
conceal
structures
of
computational
governance
and
control
over
the
transmission
of
knowledge
and
information
print
offers
a
relatively
static
and
stable
medium
by
comparison
ink
and
paper
do
not
change
much
in
transit
by
contrast
the
vessels
of
computation
are
capable
of
altering
their
contents
dynamically
imagine
me
asking
you
to
read
shakespeares
hamlet
for
example
in
lending
you
a
copy
of
the
text
in
the
case
of
a
paper
book
i
may
be
sure
that
the
text
in
my
hands
will
remain
the
same
as
i
pass
it
into
yours
but
the
computed
sign
also
has
the
capability
to
adjust
itself
to
new
contexts
for
example
the
simulated
hamlet
may
adapt
to
the
new
readers
geographic
location
mood
or
consumption
habits
in
fact
most
texts
we
consume
today
come
to
us
in
such
computationally
constructed
way
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
viewed
in
beijing
will
differ
from
that
viewed
in
new
york
the
two
pages
or
sites
are
in
some
sense
two
completely
different
textual
variants
in
another
sense
the
front
page
identifies
the
same
location
of
the
same
text
in
two
diverging
and
dynamically
composed
versions
whatever
is
meant
by
todays
edition
of
the
new
york
times
in
that
sense
denotes
differing
surface
phenomena
that
emanate
from
the
same
source
the
key
to
understanding
the
loss
of
resemblances
that
accompanies
ubiquitous
simulation
lies
in
the
inner
dynamics
of
metaphor
machinery
a
functioning
metaphor
if
you
would
recall
from
lakoff
is
one
which
transfers
the
structural
properties
of
one
domain
into
another
thus
to
say
life
is
a
stage
is
to
transpose
something
about
theater
onto
life
in
literary
terms
the
theater
is
tenor
where
life
is
vehicle
of
the
composite
figure
richardsphilosophy1936
simulations
work
differently
where
the
tenor
of
the
literary
metaphor
crosses
several
semantic
and
cognitive
domains
the
computational
metaphor
substitutes
the
signs
of
the
real
for
the
real
baudrillardsimulacra1994

it
is
a
subtle
difference
that
engenders
notsosubtle
effects
for
example
it
is
one
thing
to
say
you
are
the
apple
of
my
eye
and
quite
another
to
confuse
apples
for
eye
pupils
baudrillard
gives
us
the
example
of
a
map
that
no
longer
corresponds
to
any
territory
he
calls
such
a
condition
of
pure
simulation
without
a
referent
hyperreality
hyperreality
emanates
from
the
expected
correspondence
between
digital
representation
and
the
thing
being
represented
for
example
one
expects
weather
simulation
to
model
actual
observed
meteorological
conditions
but
would
it
be
a
weather
simulation
if
the
model
was
broken
in
some
way
or
in
the
extreme
if
it
had
no
correspondence
to
the
physics
of
clouds
wind
and
water
whatsoever
the
hyperreal
breaks
further
still
by
taking
place
of
instead
of
the
underlying
reality
a
model
does
not
merely
obscure
it
usurps
the
thing
being
modeled
it
begins
to
simulate
itself
according
to
its
own
rules
similar
to
self
the
simulation
no
longer
corresponds
to
any
situation
on
the
ground
severed
from
its
referent
representation
attains
the
status
of
the
thing
represented
therefore
hyperreality
a
map
of
a
map
a
symbol
that
folds
onto
itself
a
weather
simulation
confused
for
weather
we
know
that
physical
affordances
of
liquid
crystal
displays
lcds
and
magnetic
storage
differ
drastically
from
those
of
paper
goat
skins
or
parchment
yet
digital
surface
representation
maintains
the
illusion
of
selfsimilarity
we
are
faced
with
what
is
called
skeuomorphic
design
by
which
screen
reading
resembles
print
in
this
way
an
electronic
book
reader
mimics
the
bent
corner
of
a
wellthumbed
book
the
skeuomorphic
resemblance
constitutes
a
metaphor
worthy
of
critical
examination
the
principles
of
skeuomorphic
design
extend
a
visual
metaphor
from
one
medium
to
another
the
reader
already
knows
how
to
turn
pages
of
a
book
a
book
device
therefore
simulates
pages
to
ease
the
cognitive
burden
of
transitioning
from
paper
to
pixel
instead
of
issuing
arcane
commands
meant
for
the
machine
to
turn
the

perform

discarding

include

unfulfilled

we
hope
to

anything

the

smart

therefore
rely
on
acculturated

the

to
minimize
the

although
an

it
extends

to

the

comes
at

a
digital

a

in

to
enable

but
while

these
are
the

that

of

of

other
concealed

for

electronic

that
are

this

that
if
an

the

terms
the
idea
of

pages
should
somehow
extend
into
the

of
manipulating
digital

in
literary
terms
the
projection
of
a

the

of

by

the

readers
know
what

with

encourages

to

we

they

attributes
to
hold
true
in

receiving
the
tenor
of
the

the
turning

should
in

set
off
a

actions
in
the
target
digital
domain
turning
the
page
on
a
screen
should
correspond
to
a
similar
action
on
the
disk
but
the
action
does
not
necessarily
meet
our
expectations
the
arrangement
of
information
stored
on
the
disk
affords
different
physical
actions
from
the
arrangement
of
information
on
the
page
for
example

character

eight
bits
on

where
a

the

a
metaphor
in
a
figurative
genre
like
prose
or
poetry
suggests
novel
and
hitherto
unexplored
connections
between
domains
in
his
influential
essay
on
metaphor
the
english
literary
critic
ia
richards
wrete
that
when
we
use
metaphor
we
have
two
thoughts
of
different
things
active
together
and
supported
by
a
single
word
or
phrase
whose
meaning
is
a
resultant
of
their
interaction
richardsphilosophy1936

richardss
radical
contribution
to
the
study
of
metaphor
lay
in
the
observation
that
metaphor
operates
in
language
thought
and
action
ubiquitously
it
does
not
as
previously
thought
exist
merely
in
the
realm
of
poetic
language
thought
in
itself
richards
believed
is
metaphoric
in
that
the
mind
continually
searches
for
patterns
and
comparisons

the
motivated
metaphor
produces
insight
a
tool
to
explore
and
to
make
sense
of
the
world
by
such
means
the
known
sheds
light
onto
the
unknown
some
metaphors
are
in
this
way
more
productive
than
others
the
poetic
use
of
the
metaphor
does
not
merely
carry
meaning
across
known
domains
it
produces
new
and
unexpected
connections
between
them
to
this
effect
richards
cites
the
poet
percy
shelley
who
wrote
the
following
in
defense
of
poetry
poetic
language
is
vitally
metaphorical
that
is
it
marks
the
before
unapprehended
relations
of
things
and
perpetuates
their
apprehension
until
the
words
which
represent
them
become
through
time
signs
for
portions
or
classes
of
thoughts
instead
of
pictures
of
integral
thoughts
and
then
if
no
new
poets
should
arise
to
create
afresh
the
associations
which
have
been
thus
disorganized
language
will
be
dead
to
all
the
nobler
purposes
of
human
intercourse
shelleyessays1840
in

anticipated
what
the

metaphors
do
not
die
as
such
they
continue
to
live
but
also
become
naturalized
that
is
understood
literally
they
create
connections
that
with
time
become
habituated
and
invisible
to
their
users
in
other
words
taken
for
literal
truth
the
metaphor
loses
its
quality
of
mediation
of
ferrying
across
for
example
for
many
readers
the
idea
of
a
dead
metaphor
itself
may
no
longer
evoke
death
perhaps
they
understand
the
death
of
the
dead
metaphors
to
function
synonymously
with
convention
or
idiom
without
the
gruesome
connotations
that
accompany
the

of

in

the
creative
juxtaposition
between

with
time
the
poetic

degrades
into
a
tired
cliché
it
no

in

sense
of
becoming

lakoff
famously
took
exception
with
the
idea
of
dead
metaphors
arguing
that
even
those
metaphors
that
are
thoroughly
habituated
still
play
a
vital
part
in
structuring
everyday
experience
he
gave
the
example
of
the
sentence
he
still
cant
quite
grasp
the
basic
ideas
of
quantum
mechanics
grasping
in
this
case
is
used
as
a
synonym
to
understanding
it
indicates
a
transference
of
properties
between
physical
action
grasping
and
mental
action
understanding
despite
being
a
cliché
the
metaphor
is
alive
in
a
sense
lakoff
argues
because
it
continues
to
perform
a
function
naming
a
mental
activity
that
we
would
otherwise
find
difficult
to
explain
with
precision
such
a
metaphor
is
less
dead
than
other
perhaps
more
novel
one
off
poetic
tropes
that
fail
to
circulate
widely
the
metaphor
dies
in
the
sense
of
being
overused
but
it
dies
also
in
another
sense
for
not
being
used
at
all
a
truly
dead
metaphor
for
lakoff
is
one
in
which
the
original
source
image
no
longer
makes
sense
he
gives
the
example
of
the
english
word
pedigree
which
originally
referred
to
the
french
for
cranes
foot
or
pied
de
grue
the
foot
was
used
in
a
typographical
flourish
to
decorate
centuriesold
familytree
diagrams
in
the
previous
example
when
we
spoke
of
the
metaphorical
grasping
of
ideas
both
sides
of
the
domain
transference
were
readily
available
to
us
we
understood
something
about
grasping
things
and
extended
it
to
the
capacity
of
the
mind
to
take
hold
of
ideas
by
contrast
the
pied
de
grue
contained
within
the
english
pedigree
is
no
longer
accessible
to
the
average
speaker
in
the
first
case
the
metaphor
is
merely
tired
where
it
is
completely
dead
in
the
other
all
habituated
metaphors
like
grasping
and
pedigree
lose
their
symbolic
connotations
in
use
but
unlike
pedigree
the
metaphorical
nature
of
grasping
ideas
is
at
least
available
for
casual
interpretation
the
underlying
metaphor
the
mind
is
like
a
hand
generates
other
meaningful
phrases
like
you
have
to
let
go
of
this
idea
the
cranes
foot
in
the
english
pedigree
has
stopped
generating
new
metaphors
the
conventional
notion
of
dead
metaphors
does
not
appropriately
differentiate
between
the
two
cases
lakoffdeath1987
mullermetaphors2008
the
metaphor
sometimes
dies
but
continues
to
perform
its
function
of
intuitively
connecting
two
disparate
domains
at
other
times
the
metaphor
dies
in
the
sense
of
one
domain
becoming
no
longer
accessible
to
its
user
furthermore
we
might
add
that
a
wholly
unmotivated
metaphor
does
no
work
at
all
thus
the
mad
hatter
poses
his
famous
nonsensical
riddle
in
lewis
carrolls
alice
in
wonderland
how
is
a
raven
like
a
writing
desk
the
complete
dissimilarity
between
the
two
domainsof
animals
and
furnitureprevents
any
productive
congruence6
no
domain
mapping
happens
between
ravens
and
writing
desks
not
having
been
born
the
metaphor
dies
in
yet
another
sense
with
these
comments
on
broken
and
dead
metaphors
in
mind
we
may
ask
to
what
extent
does
the
interface
metaphor
live
or
die
by
the
above
definitions
when
discarding
a
document
into
a
trash
bin
in
our
recurring
example
users
should
theoretically
map
their
knowledge
of
paper
documents
and
paper
waste
baskets
onto
the
computational
domain
the
icon
should
work
similarly
to
the
object
it
purports
to
simulate
instead
the
idea
of
discarding
something
substitutes
for
the
material
reality
of
the
corresponding
action
the
concept
blends
not
with
another
conceptual
domain
but
with
the
material
affordances
of
the
target
medium

material
affordancesour

to
actually

principle
whatever
structural
changes
we
expect
to
happen
in

do
not

the
metaphor
breaks
almost
as
badly
as
the
transference
between
desks
and
ravens
the
appearance
of
taking
out
the
trash
without
the
corresponding
erasure
of
data
becomes
a
dead
metaphor
even
under
lakoffs
strict
definitions
as
was
the
case
with
the
cranes
foot
in
the
english
pedigree
the
user
of
the
simulated
document
dustbin
is
missing
one
part
of
the
metaphor
equation
where
in
the
case
of
pedigree
english
speakers
fail
to
grasp
the
source
or
the
tenor
of
the
metaphoric
substitution
the
case
of
the
virtual
dustbin
is
missing
the
target
or
the
vehicle
of
the
action
discarding
a
document
into
the
virtual
trash
bin
does
not
in
fact
correspond
to
a
similar
action
in
the
target
domain
of
the
storage
medium
in
either
case
in
failing
to
achieve
the
full
transference
between
source
and
target
domains
the
metaphor
ceases
to
function
properly
by
definition
lakoffdeath1987
the
interface
metaphor
fails
to
achieve
motivation
the
material
realities
of
the
metaphor
are
not
simply
missing
they
are
misrepresented
the
analogy
between
discarding
paper
and
erasing
bits
breaks
down
in
the
worst
possible
way

epitomized
the
paradigm
of
direct

according
to
ben
shneiderman
the
researcher
who
coined
the
term
in
1982
direct
manipulation
involved
three
key
principles
1
continuous
representation
of
the
object
of
interest
2
physical
actions
or
labelled
button
presses
instead
of
complex
syntax
3
rapid

operations
whose
impact
on

object
of
interest
is

visible

the
goal
of
direct
manipulation
was
therefore
to
achieve
a
perfect
correspondence
between
representation
and
the
object
of
interest
shneiderman
cites

leibniz
in
reference
to
symbolic
notation
which
in
theory
should
also
express
the
exact
nature
of
a
thing
briefly
and
as
it
were
picture
it
for
leibniz
the
symbol
an
exact
and
portable
picture
of
an
idea
could
subsequently
diminish
the
mental
effort
required
for
abstract
thought
leading
to
a
great
advantage

for

and

a
computer
game
like

similarly
enabled
the
direct

of
complex
abstractions
allowing
a
player
to
control
a
virtual
tabletennis

by
rotating
a
physical

on
a

of

without
such
a
direct
linkage
the
physics
of
the
game
simulation
would
be
too
complex
for
players
to
handle
effectively
if
they
were
asked
to
play
by
writing
formulas
in
code
for
example
or
to
direct
the
paddle
through

the
conversational
model
of
humancomputer
interaction
was
hindered
by
what
researchers
considered
an
arbitrary
symbolic
relationship
of
the
sign
to
its
signifier
in
this
way
when
using
emacs
a
text
editor
commonly
found
on
unix
systems
of
the
time
one
would
enter
the

k
in

with

to
delete
or
to

in
the
conversational
model
the
command
stood
in
an
arbitrary
relationship
to
the
intended
effect
whereas
in
the
direct

model
the
knob
and
the
movement
of
the
paddle
related
mimetically

be
more
precise

for

an

requires
no

it
is

instead
of
searching
for
the

the

relies
on
the

affordances
of
realworld
objects
like
table
tennis
paddles
and
paper
trashcans
to
manipulate
virtual
objects
like
computer
games
and

the
move
between

models
could
in
this
way
be
explained
as
a
shift
from
a
system
of
symbolic

which
stand
in

relationship
to
their
referents
to
a
system
of

that

crucially
within

the

for
heidegger
there
was
no

to

intercedes

rough

to
seem

direct
extension

i
do
not
mean
to
dismiss
the
mastery
of
those
engaged
in
creating
the
illusion
of
directness
pleasure
and
catharsis
are
important
in
some
contexts
in
other
contexts
we
must
privilege
reflection
analysis
and
interruption
computational
poetics
should
therefore
aim
to
arrest
the
encounter
to
make
it
seem
less
natural
to
bring
the
receding
media
to
light
and
to
expose
the
mediating
systems
supporting
the
simulation
a
measure
of
discomfort
in
the
fit

our
ability
to
structure
the
encounter
on
our
own
terms
to
opt
in
when
useful
and
to
opt
out
when
necessary
my
concern
is
not
with
the
metaphysical
entailments
of
a
possible
posthuman
future
the
illusion
of
directness
belies
the
very
human
mechanisms
of
command
and
control
the
simulation
ultimately
embodies
specific
power
structures
in
an
economy
of
exchange
between
physical
and
mental
resources
in
this
market
there
are
those
who
profit
and
those
whose
virtual
avatars
become
a
commodity
the
above
comments
apply
to
computation
generally
we
will
spend
the
following
chapters
peeling
apart
the
layers
of
the
literary
and
the
bibliographic
simulation
in
particular
once
the
electronic
book
can
be
perceived
as
computation
in
kind
we
can
begin
to
examine
the
incongruence
in
the
structures
of
meaningmaking
at
the
sites
of
storage
and
projection
if
we
consider
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
as
a
type
of
a
commitment
to
a
motivated
metaphor
the
following
chapters
will
help
us
understand
the
ways
of
seeing
and
the
material

of
getting
the
electronic
book

fore

the

change
in

from
speaking
to

the
most
obvious
change
from
speaking
to
writing
concerns
the
relation
between
message
and
its
medium
or
channel
at
first
glance
it
concerns
only
this
relation
but
upon
closer
examination
the

alteration
