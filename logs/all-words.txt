an
introduction
while
i
write
these
introductory
remarks
a
ceilingmounted
smoke
detector
in
my
kitchen
emits
a
loud
noise
every
three
minutes
or
so
a
pleasant
female
voice
announces
also
low
battery
this
is
i
learn
a
precaution
stipulated
by
us
national
fire
alarm
code

2013
the
clause
requiring
a
distinct
audible
signal
before
the
battery
is
incapable
of
operating
is
encoded
into
the
device
the
smoke
detector
literally
embodies
that
piece
of
legislation
in
its
circuitry
we
thus
obtain
a
condition
where
two
meanings
of
codeas
governance
and
machine
instructioncoincide
code
equals
code
i
am
at
home
but
i
also
receive
a
notification
of
the
alarm
on
my
mobile
phone
along
with
monitoring
apps
that
help
make
my
home
smarter
the
phone
contains
most
of
my
library
i
often
pick
it
up
to
read
a
book
however
the
phrase
reading
a
book
obscures
a
number
of
metaphors
for
a
series
of
odd
actions
the
book
is
a
small
thin
black
rectangle
three
inches
wide
five
inches
tall
and
barely
a
few
millimeters
thick
a
slab
of
polished
glass
covers
the
front
of
the
device
where
the
tiny
eyes
of
a
camera
and
a
light
sensor
also
protrude
at
the
back
made
of
smooth
soft
plastic
we
find
another
larger
camera
at
the
foot
of
the
device
a
grid
of
small
perforations
indicates
breathing
room
for
a
speaker
and
several
microphones
to
open
a
book
i
touch
the
glass
the
machine
recognizes
my
fingerprint
almost
instantly
i
then
tap
and
poke
at
the
surface
until
i
find
a
small
image
that
represents
both
my
library
and
book
store
where
i
can
buy
books
buying
books
does
not
however
involve
the
actual
ownership
of
physical
objects
rather
i
agree
to
a
licence
that
grants
limited
access
to
data
which
the
software
then
assembles
into
something
resembling
a
book
on
screen
i
tap
again
to
begin
reading
the
screen
dims
to
match
room
ambiance
as
it
fills
up
with
words
a
passage
on
the
first
page
appears
underlined
other
readers
in
my
social
circle
must
have
found
it
notable
i
swipe
across
the
glass
surface
to
turn
a
page
the
device
emits
a
muffled
rustle
to
reinforce
the
pretense
of
manipulating
paper
the
image
curls
ever
so
slightly
as
another
page
slides
into
view
my
tiny
library
metaphor
contains
hundreds
of
such
page
metaphors
despite
appearances
the
electronic
metaphormaking
device
on
my
desk
has
more
in
common
with
smoke
detectors
than
it
does
with
several
paper
volumes
scattered
on
my
desk
the
electronic
book
and
smoke

contain
printed
circuit
boards
capacitors
and
resistors
both
draw
electric
current
both
require
firmware
updates
and
both
are
governed
by

political
and
computational
smoke
alarms
and
mobile
phones
connect
to
the
internet
they
communicate
with
distant
data
centers
and
with
each
other
and
yet
i
continue
to
read
these
devices
as
if
they
were
familiar
immutable
and
passive
objects
just

i
think
of
them
as

we

signal
an

to
an
editorial
method
of

transcription

is
both
faithful

cookconsiderations1988
combining
these
two
traditions
i
mean
ultimately
to
build
a
case
for
a
kind
of
a
systematic
minimalism
when
it
comes
to
our
use
of
computersa
minimalism
that
privileges
access
to

materials
ensuring
legibility
and
comprehension
i
do
so
in
contrast
with
other
available

which
instead
privilege

like

identifies
an
interpretive
stance
one
can
assume
in
relation
to
the
making
and
the
unmaking
of
literary

besides
visible
content
all
contemporary
documents
carry
with
them
a
layer
of
hidden
information
originally
used
for
typesetting
that
layer
affects
more
than
innocuous

attributes
like

or

increasingly
devices
that
mediate
literary
activity
also
embody
governing
structures

the

act
passed
in
the

in

report

to

emanate

plain

is
a
response
to
a
particular
situation
of
a
literary
scholar
encountering
the
field
of
software
engineering
for
a
long
stretch
of
my
professional
life
these
two
areas
of
activity
remained
separate
i
worked
at
one
and
i
studied
the
other
at
the
time
i
simply
did
not
think
that

had
much
to
do
with
poetry
initially
my
two

was
and
continues
to
be
a
disconcerting
process
by
which
things
dear
and
familiar
to
me
in
both
worlds
grew
strange
and
unfamiliar
showing
themselves
to
be
sometimes
less
than
and
sometimes
more
than
i
comfortably
expected
nothing
could
be
assumed
from

specific

down
to
its
foundations
had
to
be

that
code
and

have
much
to
do
with
one
another
writing
this
book
has
taught
me
to
embrace
the
remaining
incongruence
the
idea
for
plain
text
came
in
a
moment
of
realization
after
i
was
asked
one
of
those
seemingly
naive
but
fundamental
questions
that
can
set
research
in
motion
down
a
long
and
winding
path
a
childhood
friend
who
shares
a
love
for
reading
asked
why
he
could
not
lend
me
a
copy
of
the
novel
that
he
recently
purchased
from
a
major
online
retailer3
in
my
struggle
to
answer
i
realized
that
some
of
my
deepest
intuitions
about
literature
relied
on
assumptions
firmly
attached
to
print
media
despite
my
professional
experience
as
a
programmer
and
academic
training
in
literary
studies
i
could
not
readily
explain
the
mechanisms
by
which
electromagnetic
charges
transformed
into
pixels
and
pixels
into
words
where
to
begin
to
recount
the
passage
of
digital
text
one
has
to
know
something
about
chip
architecture
operating
systems
file
permissions
networking
and
encryption
i
could
describe
parts
of
that
ecosystem
but
my
knowledge
was
also
riddled
with
unexamined
gaps
it
did
not
amount
to
a
coherent
story
worse

quickly

the

changed
as
it

hands
i
now
had
to
draw
on
philology
and
sociology
of
literature
to
reflect
on
textual
variants

and
authorship

digital

was
more
obviously
entwined

its

the

it
was
marked
and

the
work
was
preprocessed
in
both
technical
and
social
senses
of
the

to
privilege
certain
meanings
and
modes
of

the
task
of
coming
to

with

as
halstead
anticipated
research
into
codification
has
led
me
to
a
rich
multidisciplinary
archive
of
materials
from
the
history
of
literary
theory
semiotics
telegraphy
and
electrical
engineering
from
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
that
archive
includes
patents
and
technical
manuals
formalist
manifestos
studies
of
animal
communication
humancomputer
interaction
textbooks
as
well
as
foundational
texts
in
aesthetics
and

i
deploy
the
archive
to
argue
that
extant

of

evolved
under
conditions
tied
to
static
print
media
by
contrast
digital
text
changes
dynamically
to
suit
its
reader
political
context
and

consequently
i
advocate
for
the
development
of
computational
poetics
a
strategy
of
interpretation
capable
of
reaching
past
surface
content
to
reveal
platforms
and
infrastructures
that
stage
the
construction
of
meaning
where
distant
reading
and
cultural
analytics
perceive
patterns
across
largescale
corpora
computational
poetics
breaks
textuality
down
into
its
minute
constituent
components
it
is
a
strategy
of

my

builds
also
on
the
long

in
the
genealogy

approach
is
not
however
limited
to
the
canonical
straightahead
structuralisms
of
roman
jakobson
or
jonathan

i
am
borrowing
rather
from
a
more
peripheral
tradition
represented
best
by
third
culture
thinkers
like
viktor
shklovsky
and
vilém
flusser
consummate
immigrants
both
who
extracted
a
methodology
out
of
the

of
their

flusser

considered

comes
with

physical
and

one
could
write
to
take
a

example
a

of

without

shklovsky

a

would

the

shows

thus
when
life
passes
without

it
passes
as
if

has

shklovsky
adds
that
life
so

into

must
that
may
seem

at

to
recover
the

the
physical
minutiae
of
the
encounter
between
text
and

the
point
of

between
human
text

is
significant
because
it
is
here
in
the
liminal
zone
of
semiotic
exchange
where
subjects
disappear
into
machines
and
where
machines
step
forth
as
animated

seemingly
intelligent

our
ability
to
apprehend
the

therefore
depends
on

also
semiotic
and

in

amenable
to

i
further
encourage
those
who
may
have
considered
themselves
mere

to
apply
the

critical
acuity
they
employ
in

constitutes
a
primitive
field
of
textual
activity
at
the
crossroads
of
computer
science
and
the
study
of

encoding
matters
because
how

my
approach
to
writing
plain
text
stems
from
the
desire
to
enact
theory
capable
of
addressing
the
grim
picture
friedrich
kittler
painted
at
the
end
of
his
influential
monograph17
by
all
accounts
kittler
was
neither
a
technological
romantic
nor
luddite
i
hence
understand
his
gramophone
film
typewriter
as
a
call
to
action
when
kittler
wrote
that
media
determine
our
situation
he
challenged
his
reader
to
choose
between
complicity
and
defiance

an

it

the

by
pamela
smith
amy
meyers

they
write
that
the

of

is
not
a

of

or
at

not
that
alone

a

of
the

of

i
will
therefore
occasionally
encourage

anew
to
put

to

away

with

in

pitting
them
against

through

in

a

this
book
is
thus
neither
a
total
history
of
modern
computing
nor
a
survey
of
literary
theory
rather
the
argument
therein
progresses
from
the
action
of
the

keyboard
switch
through
copper
and
silicon
to
liquid
crystal
and
the
floating

and
on
towards
the

and

it
is
but
one
of
many
possible
passes
through
a
cavernous
black
box
at
the
core
of
the
books
first
chapter
lies
the
notion
of
a
modernist
literary
device
understood
both
as
literary
technique
and
a
thought
experiment
about
intelligent
machines
directly
connected
to
the
birth
of
modern
computing
a
section
on
literary
technique
in
the
thought
of
percy
lubbock
walter
benjamin
and
mikhail
bakhtin
opens
the
discussion
materialist
poetics
rise
concomitantly
alongside
a
mechanistic
rulebased
view
of
language
in
this
chapter
i
reconstruct
a
series
of
thought
experiments
first
in
the
writing
of
ludwig
wittgenstein
and
then
in
alan
turings
seminal
paper
on
an
imaginary
computer
capable
of
reading
and
writing
the
verbs
to
read
and
to
write
imply
a
type
of
cognitive
processing
what
does
it
mean
to
read
and
to
write
for
a
machine
what
about
broken
mechanisms
of
comprehension
at
once
a
device
and
an
algorithm
the
turing
machine
blurs
the
boundaries
between
software
and
hardware
code
and
content
intelligence
and
its
imitation
the
passage
from
keystroke
to
pixel
gives
this
book
its
shape
in
the
chapters
to
follow
our
mobile
phones
and
laptops
will
come
fully
into
view
as
metaphor
machines
engendering
ubiquitous
simulation
the
second
chapter
begins
with
an
question
what
does
it
mean
to
turn
a
page
i
ask
when
neither
the
page
nor
the
action
of
turning
it
correspond
to
their
implied
analogies
the
analysis
of
the
metaphor
helps
trace
the
intellectual
history
of
humancomputer
interaction
a
field
which
progressed
from
conversational
programming
to
the
direct
manipulation
paradigm
shaped
by
theories
of
cognitive
metaphor
and
immersive
theater
the
logic
of
directness
leads
to
the
rapidly
developing
field
of
braincomputer
interfaces
the
chapter
concludes
with
a
moment
of
speculative
formalism
in
which
i
consider
the
possibility
of
affective
literature
of
the
kind
that
eschews
language
and
representation
two
rich
intellectual
histories
collide
in
the
third
chapter
one
the
material
history
of
format
as
a
concept
in
computer
science
and
the
other
the
intellectual
history
of
form
in
literary
theory
i
show
formatting
as
a
process
that
mediates
between
the
texts
intrinsic
rules
for
construction
and
its
extrinsic
shape
transforming
one
type
of
structure
a
series
of
bits
arranged
into
tracks
and
sectors
into
another
letters
arranged
into
sentences
and
paragraphs
i
then
draw
a
short
history
of
text
formats
it
begins

the

restore

lost

with

major
sideeffect
they
cannot
guarantee

this

the

to
a

the

also
the
aesthetics
of
digital

works
by
the
philosophers
henri
bergson

nelson

help
construct
a
phenomenology
of
screenbased
digital
perception
the
digital
emerges
ultimately
not
as
an
intrinsic
property
of
the

but
as
structure
imposed
from

properties
that
make
media
digital
or
analog
reveal
themselves
to
be
neither
universal
nor
essential
to
the
medium
the
medium
is
not
the
message
the
reliability
and
preservation
of
textual
copies
may
mean
one
thing
to
a
literary
scholar
another
to
a
software
engineer
or
a
legal
professional
and
something
entirely
different
to
a
librarian
i
argue
in
the
conclusion
of
the
chapter
it
matters
not
what
the
medium
is
but
what
we
can
do
with
the
text
the
fifth
and
final
chapter
begins
with
a
discussion
of
an
apparent
paradox
a
camp
of
media
theorists
and
textual
scholars
in
the
1990s
conceived
of
electronic
texts
as
an
ephemeral
almost
immaterial
phenomenon
text
shimmered
and
glared
it
was
spoken
of
in
terms
of
hypertext
light
writing
and
electricity
a
generation
of
theorists
that
came
after
insisted
on
the
weighty
materiality
of
electronic
media
reading
began
to
engage
the
morphology
of
rare
metals
media
archaeology
hard
drive
forensics
both
accounts
i
argue
capture
an
aspect
of
the
same
underlying
condition
the
perceived
image
of
an
archived
inscription
splits
from
its
source
the
sign
plausibly
resides
both
on
screen
and
on
hard
drive
it
fractures
in
some
real
sense
diverging
at
the
site
its
projection
from
the
site
of
the
archive
using
archival
materials
from
the
history
of
telegraphy
in
the
late
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
i
chart
the
gradual
fracture
and
the
ultimate
illegibility
of
the
newly
composite
sign
early
computers
stored
humanreadable
text
and
machine
instruction
at
the
surface
of
the
same
storage
media
like
punch
cards
and
ticker
tape
although
difficult
to
read
these
forms
of
machine
writing
were
readily
visible
and
therefore
amenable
to
analysis
the
advent
of
magnetic
storage
forced
the
composite
inscription
into
an
opaque
medium
unable
to
perceive
magnetic
polarities
without
the
aid
of
a
machine
readers
often
manipulated
text
blindly
in
this
way
a
typist
would
type
several
sentences
without
seeing
the
printed
output
the
chapter
identifies
a
milestone
in
the
history
of
human
textuality
the
moment
at
which
the
inscription
passed
from
view
giving
rise
to
the
sometimes
conflicting
but
nevertheless
consistent
accounts
of
digital
textuality
a
short
conclusion
gestures
towards
the
contemporary
political
consequences
of
the
material
covered
discussing
also
the
possibility
of
machine
phenomenology
in
relationship
to
humanism
perspective

history
of

the
challenge

of

be
in

it

the
blunt

we

i
borrow
the
term
microanalysis
from
the
largely
forgotten
in
the
west
russian
literary
scholar
and
member
of
the
moscow
linguistic
circle
boris
iarkho
in
his
methodologies
of
exact
literary
study
circa
19356
he
wrote
i
understand
atomism
as
a
sort
of
an
ideal
aspiration
as
an
orientation
toward
the
liminally
small
but
under
no
circumstances
do
i
advocate
working
with
hypothetical
quantities
like
molecules
atoms
positrons

so
on

are
located

the
limits
of
perception
that
this
applied
mythology
gave
us
such
splendid
results
in
chemistry
should
not
conceal
its
true
nature
tomorrow
all
such
explanations
of
visible
through
the
invisible
could
give
way
to
other
hypotheses
as
was
the
case
with
their
no

fertile
predecessors

phlogiston

the

endure
