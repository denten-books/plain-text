## Medium not the Message (attunement)

By "encoding," I mean a "controlled system of representation." Representation
in its unrestrained form (as in "pictorial representation") differs from
"encoding" in the size of its vocabulary. Painting and other forms of
uninhibited representational conventions are limitless in their expressive
possibility. The "language" of painting is infinite, in other words. Encoding,
by contrast, reduces the universe of possibilities to a limited set of salient
"codes," like the alphabet. These codes have a formal grammar and rules of
composition. Although the expressive potential of written language is
limitless, in some combinatorial sense of the word, language and other codes
can "break," that is, be reduced to nonsense, in a way that painting cannot. A
telegraph of the single-Morse type accepts alpha-numeric characters at first
and then translates them into a system of signals, expressed in time intervals
(between the synchronization tone and the activation of the key).

It becomes clear from the description of early telegraph encoding systems that
transcoding and transmediation relate to each other somehow. On one hand, all
changes between encoding systems necessitate material phase transition, if not
from one type of medium into another (from paper to magnetic storage, for
example), then from one specific material context into another (as when one
merely translates from French into English on the same piece of paper).
Transmediation, on the other hand, may or may not involve a change in encoding
formats, although it frequently does, as when language on paper is transformed
into the pulsations of the electrical signal in Morse code. In reading and
playing music, a musician furthermore transforms musical notation---a
controlled, paper-bound vocabulary---into sound representation, the movement of
molecules unlimited in its expressive potential.
What matters is that the medium is largely independent from the type of
information stored on it, and this contrary to Marshall McLuhan infamous "the
medium is the message" dictum.15 The world itself "medium" is misleading in
this context. We could for example say that paint is the medium of painting.
But what about the photograph of a painting? Or its digital reproduction? The
situation is even more confusing when we begin thinking about music, for
example. What is the medium for J.S.  Bach's Double Violin Concerto: the
violin or the music sheet which contains the score? We are on yet more
precarious terrain when considering hybrid "media," like film or television
that are comprised of multiple sources and that use multiple modes of
transmission.  The confusion enters the conversation when we conflate the
modality of the information (e.g. music, image, text) with the physical
channel of its transmission (the medium proper). Modality may very well be the
message. Thus, it may be true that when one plays the violin, the music can be
said to express itself in musical terms. But not the violin! I could use a
violin to transmit a picture of an orchestra over a dial-up modem, for
example. This would only involve the question of how to encode the visual
information into a state transmittable by the violin (a primarily auditory
instrument).  The channel of communication—the medium proper—is in fact,
information-agnostic. That is to say that it has no preference about the
message being transmitted (nor can it have a preference for anything at all,
formally speaking—preference being a property we ascribe to objects that are
at least animate). We could therefore transmit a sonata by playing a violin,
as sheet-music, on a vinyl disk, recorded on tape, or by using an illegal
peer-to-peer network. In each case, the information transmitted remains more
or less the same, depending on the quality of your violin playing, the
fidelity of your speakers, or the compression ratio of your digital encoding.
It would be wrong too to consider any of these sources as somehow primal, with
others being something like "mere copies" of the original. We could for
example, start by composing music on paper. Alternatively, we could first play
a piece of music and then transcribe it into musical notation. In an extreme
but perfectly plausible case, we could compose by magnetizing a length of
ferrous tape first, and only then play the violin to reproduce what we have
"written." The medium does not know anything about the message. The way in
which we store, access, and retrieve the encoded information is determined by
the medium, however. We are the ones being shaped by the media. I do mean this
rather literally: the stage directions for Krapp's Last Tape would be very
different were Krapp writing a diary, or browsing his online social networking
profile, or if he were to embed a memory chip in his brain that was able to
store and retrieve the same messages from his thirty-nine year-old self as the
tape-recorder. The actor's body would move differently in each of these
cases—his senses and his thought would be altered in many subtle ways,
depending on the channel of communication.

The separation between mode and medium allows us to retain a certain clarity of
vision in a rather muddled conversation about "media history." Modalities such
as visual arts, music or literature do not necessarily evolve, in the normative
sense of the word. Yes, it may be true that Filippo Brunelleschi invented the
optical linear perspective in 1425. But the normative evolution of art could
only make sense only against some concrete pragmatic goals, which the aesthetic
realm lacks by definition. Nothing is gained or lost when the fashion changes
from square-toed to pointy-toed shoes, and then back again—to use an example
that would surely please Mr. Krapp. Neither is "better" or "worse" for the
participants in that sphere of cultural activity. By contrast, the concept of
the medium does contain some sense of normative valuation, also by definition.
That is to say that the medium has a job, which is to facilitate the storage,
the transmission, and the retrieval of information. And there is such a thing
as doing this job better or more efficiently. More is always better in this
case: more storage, faster access, more reliable transmission. When the quality
of the information is not sacrificed, there are no instances were less would be
preferable by anyone with limited time and resources. For example, I would like
to be able to read or write faster. I value both of these activities, but my
time to perform them is limited by my lifespan. Assuming I could gain speed
without any degradation in clarity or comprehension, and barring any
psychological ill effects, the idea of more in this case must be a good onto
itself.

Digitality, as I will argue for the duration of the book, constitutes a part
of the human condition worthy of conservation. But, what I mean by "digital
being" relates to the practice of buying "digital cameras" or to promoting the
"digital humanities" in name only. To perceive what is at stake, we must do
much more to disambiguate the digital cognates: electronic, binary, and
computational.


## Copy

This property further had the effect of freeing digital representation from
its medium. A Rembrandt is bound to its canvas in a way that Shakespeare's
*Hamlet* is not.  Digital systems are media independent. *Hamlet* can be
reproduced on paper or stone, in Morse code, or bound in liquid crystal, and
still be *Hamlet* in some natural understanding of the work. 

The division of text into form and content makes a difference in more
utilitarian ways as well. For example, imagine the challenge of compiling all
known commentaries on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, by hand or programmatically. The
problem of what edition to use as the "base" for such a project presents itself
immediately. In the words of Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine, the editors of
*Folger Digital Texts*, "readers assume that there is a single text for the
plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare's plays were not published the
way modern novels or plays are today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions,
represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by
his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example,
three very different versions of *Hamlet*, two of *King Lear*, *Henry V*,
*Romeo and Juliet*, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their
base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from
the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text" [@mowat_textual_2012]. In other words, where the readers expect to
encounter *Hamlet* as a single, unified idea, they instead encounter a
multiplicity of slightly diverging textual "witnesses." Errors in transcription
and editorial interventions accumulate. The proliferation of unlicensed copies,
translations, and imitations further adds to the complexity of the problem.

Editors of classical literature will often solve the problem of diverging
copies by designating one version as canonical, preserving the formal
characteristics of the given version down to individual line breaks, as is
often done with Platonic dialogs. It then becomes possible to collate
commentaries, connecting each to individual words and passages at their
canonical location. The problem remains in the abstract: which version to count
as canonical? The act of deciding on what constitutes an authoritative edition
can quickly become a contentious issue, particularly when the text in question
carries religious or political significance.

A whole field of textual criticism exists in the service of negotiating
"critical" editions which in some way preserve the struggle to reconstruct a
measure of authority. But what should count for being authoritative? A number
of logical possibilities find as many ardent adherents. For some, the act of
deriving the authoritative text lies in reconstructing authorial intent, using
the author's notes, for example, or from first-hand witness testimony. Others
place a premium on reconstructing and analyzing the writing process itself, in
what has been dubbed as "genetic criticism" [@deppman_genetic_2004, 1-36]. Yet
another approach will compare multiple editions of the same text to derive a
possible meta-text, preserving all extant variations. Yet others will simply
rely on their judgment to produce what they believe is a "true" text based on a
number of personal and eclectic considerations [@bowers_rationale_1950,
@bowers_shakespeares_1954, @mcgann_radiant_2001]. Such approaches to textual
criticism have at least this one thing in common: behind the fuzzy profusion of
textual material they perceive the outlines of a single, unified work. As G.
Thomas Tanselle (a prominent textual scholar) puts it, "one must be able to
distinguish the work itself from attempts to reproduce it."[^ln11-tanselle] For
a textual critic of his kind, all real-word variants and reproductions are
suspect because possibly corrupt in some way. Despite its careful attention to
the materiality of the text as artifact, textual criticism in this vein remains
a classically idealistic pursuit. The work exists as an ideal form in the realm
of the ideal.

[ln11-tanselle]:  "Whatever concept of authorship one subscribes to, the act of
reading or listening to receive a message from the past entails the effort to
discover, through the text (or texts) one is presented with, the work that lies
behind" [@tanselle_rationale_2010, 13-18.].

Ruskin lamp of memory.

"It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that
has every been great or beautiful in architecture [...] That spirit which is
given only by the hand and eye of the workman, never can be recalled. Another
spirit may be given by another time, an it is then a new building; but the
spirit of the dead workman cannot be summoned up, and commanded to direct other
hands, and other thoughts. And as for direct and simple copying, it is palpably
impossible. What copying can there be of surfaces that have been worn half an
inch down [@staniforth_historical_2013, 2]?"

"But it is said there may come a necessity for restoration! Granted. Look the
necessity full in the face and understand it on its own terms. It is a
necessity for destruction. Accept it as such, pull the building down, throw its
stones into neglected corners, make ballast of them, or mortar, if you will'
but do it honestly, and do not set up a Lie in its
place"[@staniforth_historical_2013, 3].

On the Restoration of The Circumcision by Signorelli. "At Volterra, over the
alter of a Company in the Church of S. Francesco, he painted in fresco the
Circumcision of Our Lord, which in considered beautiful to a marvel, although
the Infant, having been injured by damp, was restored by Sodoma and made much
less beautiful than before. And, in truth, it would be sometimes better to
leave works half spoilt, when they have been made by men of excellence, rather
than to have them retouched by inferior masters." 1550 Tim's Vermeer.

Colliveau set about [restoring]this picture with uncommon solenity, because it was his
own. He began with the most delicate pumice stone, and very soon got into the
walls of th building, but was astonished to find the apearance of bricks and
mortar still, although not guite soneat; he soon cleared away the wall on
discovering a room beyond, and pictures, furniture, &c. most beautiful.
Gracious powers! how was he agitated; forgetting totally the mischief he was
commiting, his elbow went like a fiddler's; every thing vanished.---However,
finding a bed, the curtains of which (a dark green) were drawn close, he went
to work upon it ver tenderly; presently a pot de chambre came  in sight!---His
whole souldwas absorbed; his face all one ghastly grin; his legs (like German
flutes) tottered under him. Not that great philosopher Guffin Ragba, was more
agitated while cutting the leather from off his bellow, to disover how wind was

he found a lady asleep, very beautiful, because very fat, and a Dutch woman.
Now this part I did not see, and I believe but very few besides himself; but
alas! hew was soon to be at the end of his discoveries. Having got a glimpse of
some gilding, he redoubled his efforts, when he found it was an inscription; it
was in Dutch, and nearly thus, as translated by Mr. Peter La Cave:---"Now
caitiff, meditate on th havoc though hast made throughout thy lie, and go thang
thyself. In this picture, wretch! though have destroyed, what to the end of the
world, can never be replaced." [@bomford_issues_2004, 44-45]. Originally from

"The sculptor wastes away th rudo block til he has accomplished the desired

hides, as he rogresses all the preliminary layers upon which the etxternal
colours depend for durability and lustre. And hence, not on the meaning and
spririt of the work must be understood; the restorer must also be familiar with
