# Chapter 1: Laying Bare the Device

As I write these words, a ceiling-mounted smoke detector in my kitchen emits a
loud noise every three minutes or so. And at every 15 minutes, a pleasant
female voice announces also "low battery." These precautions are stipulated by
US National Fire Alarm Code 72-108 11.6.6 (2013). The clause requiring a
"distinct audible signal before the battery is incapable of operating" is not
only required by law, it is *built into the device*. The device internalizes
legislation in its programming. We obtain the condition where the two meanings
of code---as governance and program instruction---coincide. Code equals code.

I am not at home. But I know the alarm is happening because I receive
notifications of it on another small computational appliance, next to my
laptop. This appliance also contains most of my book library. Despite the
appearances, the electronic book reader-library next to my computer has more in
common with the smoke detector than it does with several paper volumes also
scattered across my desk. Both devices comprise printed circuit boards,
capacitors, silicone chips, and resistors. Both draw electric current. Both
require firmware updates. Both are governed by codes political and
computational. Both are connected to the network and both communicate: with
remote data centers and with each other. And yet, I continue to read electronic
books as if they were familiar, immutable, and passive objects: just books. I
think of them as intimate artifacts---friends even---wholly known to me,
comforting, and benign. The literary device is none of these things. It records
my reading, sleeping, and consumption habits. It comes with a manual and terms
of service. In short, it *governs* reading. At times, it reconfigures itself
dynamically, affecting all content I have delegated to the device: books,
memories, pictures, words, and thoughts.

In this chapter, the literary artifact on my desk will come into view as a
computational device. I will insist on our ability to read such devices with
the aim of developing a hermeneutics of computational reading. Ultimately, I
will argue (a) that the computer, exemplified by the Turing machine, stands at
the root of *simulated textuality*, (b) that the material history computing
belongs equally to the history of text processing as it does to the history of
machine control, and (c) that the simulated sign splits to reside in at least
two distinct locations, screen and storage medium: the first conspicuous but
ephemeral, the second enduring but opaque. Any reference to the "illusion" of
the simulated text, as opposed to print, has roots in such ambiguity of
location.

It will take us the rest of the book to come to terms with ambiguous textuality
in its bifurcated form. For now, we begin merely with the peculiarity of its
location. It exists at multiple sites at the same time. The purpose of this
chapter is to locate the object of literary study. I mean "object" literally,
as a material thing that can be seen and touched and found on desks. This is
not a trivial endeavor when it comes to simulated text. Device reading happens
on screens that refresh themselves at a rate of around 60 cycles per second
(Hertz). Screen textuality is therefore by definition ephemeral. It is
technically an animation. It moves even as it appears to stand still. Yet
paradoxically, simulated text is also pervasive. Precisely because it adheres
lightly to its medium, it has a tendency to multiply and to spread widely. Like
the fine particles of glitter, it is difficult to contain. The simulated text
falls apart into bits and pixels that tumble about the system.

A word about the vocabulary: I will often refer to the glitter-like persistence
of simulated text as "textual diffusion." And I will usually prefer "simulated
text" over "digital" or "electronic," because simulation is the real intended
after-effect of computing. As we will later see, Universal Turing machines can
even be enacted by mechanical means alone. Thus neither "electronic" nor
"digital" captures the essence of the simulation. Beyond "computability," we
will confront computers as machines for textual diffusion. We will encounter
them as ultimate metaphor machines: universal devices designed for the making
of all possible metaphors.

The diffusion of simulated text will lead us to an archive of source materials
somewhat unusual for a work on literary theory. It will allow us to perceive
computation as a type of a literary activity, comprehensible in the lineage of
symbolism and book history. In search for the location of the symbol, we will
encounter a number of symbolic mechanisms that facilitate the production of all
texts. They will be found on the pages of mathematical journals and in patent
portfolios. Their ubiquity necessitates our attention. Three such mechanisms,
which have fundamentally changed the nature of the literary encounter, will
emerge by the end of the chapter. Together, they tell the story of a bargain
that defines human--computer interaction: to trade facility for comprehension,
to take on added complexity in return for the illusion of material
transcendence, and to exist within that illusion without understanding how it
is made.

## 1.1 Literary Device as Gadget and Technique

What is a literary device? The formal concept of a "device," widely used in
literary studies, is an artifact of an unfortunate translation from Russian.
The word *priem* would be much better translated as "technique," in the sense
of "method," "approach," or "procedure." The word "device" contains these
meanings as well, but in modern usage, it usually carries a more concrete
connotation, as "an object, machine, or piece of equipment that has been made
for a special purpose" (Merriam-Webster). "Laying bare the device," for Viktor
Shklovsky, the Russian formalist critic who coined the phrase, meant making
explicit the implied mechanism of the metaphor, particularly in cases where
such metaphors turn "stale," "automatic," and "naturalized," that is, bereft of
their original poetic and evocative power.

One could write, for example, "a field of study," without much thought about
figurative space. Shklovsky would have the reader pause to consider the
implications [@shklovksy_sborniki_1917]. In what sense do ideas resemble (or
not) a field? The poet could further make the metaphor strange. To evoke a
light-hearted illustration one could write: "to scythe a verdant field of
literary study." The verb (to scythe) and the adjective (verdant) create an
unexpected transference of qualities not present in the original image of the
intellectual field. They added properties "break" the metaphor, exposing it's
conceit. To take the metaphor to its logical conclusion, a writer could depict
several fictional characters in the act of mowing a field of grass while
discussing the relative merits of structuralism: a discussion about the field
on a field. The literary artifice makes actual the implied connections between
a field of grass and an intellectual field. The writer now shows what was
merely told before. The technique of defamiliarization finally renews the
figure: discarding the hardened clichés and suggesting novel linkages between
constituent concepts: the intellectual chaff, the leaves of mental grass, the
combines of thought.

When pursuing estrangement the author "lays bare" and "makes obvious" the
metaphor by drawing attention to its inner dynamics. Metaphors, as Lakoff and
Johnson famously argued, do more than decorate---they structure everyday human
activity. The metaphor shapes one system of conceptual relationships in terms
of another. For example, the military image of "fortification defence" implies
a conceptual system structuring the "defence of an argument"
[@lakoff_metaphors_1980, 3-14]. When defending the argument, a speaker acts in
the way that resembles combat. A different metaphor would suggest a less
combative mode of engagement between interlocutors.

The Russian formalists of the early twentieth century did not quite have the
contemporary cognitive vocabulary to connect mind and symbol, but they did
understand estrangement as a matter of everyday practice, beyond linguistic
analysis. One of Shklovsky's central concerns was with the automatization of
human experience, by which metaphors lose their evocative power through
repeated use. Such metaphors become mere machines that convey meaning, and,
when habituated, disappear from view. According to the Kantian view, in vogue
in Russia at the time, the human proceed through life with the assumption of
agency, structuring one's own experiences according to the principles of free
will. Instead, the passive metaphor structures furtively, obscuring the free
play of relationships involved.

Estrangement de-automates the experience [@shklovksy_sborniki_1917,
@shklovsky_hod_1923, @boym_estrangement_1996, @holquist_minding_2005]. The
interpretation of a metaphor recovers agency lost to the blind mechanization of
thought. Through defamiliarization, readers discover the principles governing
their actions: free to accept some parts of the conceptual transference (the
intellectual field *is* "verdant"!) and to reject others (but let us not "use
combines" to "harvest" it).

Vladimir Nabokov, a writer conspicuously aware of his literary--theoretical
heritage, used defamiliarization in the formalist vein often and with
relentless clinical precision. In the short story "A Guide to Berlin," to which
D. Barton Johnson attributes our first glimpse at Nabokov's "mature virtuoso
style [@johnson_guide_1979, 354]," Nabokov writes:

> In front of the house where I live, a gigantic black pipe lies along the
outer edge of the sidewalk. A couple of feet away, in the same file, lies
another, then a third and a fourth---the street's iron entrails, still idle,
not yet lowered into the ground, deep under the asphalt. For the first few days
after they were unloaded, with a hollow clanging, from trucks, little boys
would run on them, up and down, and crawl on all fours through those round
tunnels, but a week later nobody was playing anymore and thick snow was falling
instead; and now when, cautiously probing the treacherous glaze of the sidewalk
with my thick rubber-heeled stick, I go out in the flat gray light of the
morning, an even stripe of fresh snow stretches along the upper side of each
black pipe [...] Today someone wrote "Otto" with his finger on the strip of
virgin snow, and I thought how beautifully that name, with its two soft o's
flanking the pair of gentle consonants suited the silent layer of snow upon
that pipe with its two orifices and its tacit tunnel [@nabokov_guide_1976, 27].

The tightly wound vignette takes the formalist programmatic concern with
"laying bare the device" to its logical and recursively structured conclusion.
The pipes can be read as a metaphor for the literary device. Usually found
beneath the street, they now sit idle and visible above the surface. Yet even
when exposed, the device fails to captivate for long. Disused, it passes out
sight, covered in snow. Concerned with surfaces, the narrator "probes the
glaze" of the street. He finds a palindrome written in snow. The inscription
"OTTO" not only resembles the pipes visually, but is in itself a
surface-revealing inscription that makes the pipes visible again, through the
snow. Although the metaphoric pipe cannot reach beyond the page, the mimetic
surface inscription draws attention to the word's visual shape and acoustics.
It invites readers to perform the symmetry of its assonance and consonance as
they pronounce the word. The round vowels and the interrupting obstruents of
"OTTO" contort the body in accordance with the sound image: reverse mimesis,
the body as sound pipe. The moment of corporeal reenactment transcends
representational and paper-bound confines of the medium. The pipes appear
briefly on this side of the page. The performance makes the "making of the
literary technique obvious," obvious. In this, lies the prevalent
characteristic of Nabokov's mature work, which often seeks to rise above the
word through sheer recursion of literary technique, where each successive turn
of abstraction brings the buried symbol closer to the reader.

Yet for all the transcendent language games, the formalist's use of the
literary device rarely enacted the opposition motion, down, towards the
materiality of the written word. As I explain at length in the later chapters,
formalists scholarship concerned matter primarily as structure and
sound.[^ln1-formal] Paper, the literal substance intervening between the two,
remained for them a transparent medium. Concerned with the stripping of
surfaces, the formalist and later new critical research agendas stopped at the
representational layer of the literary figure. I would like to take the
formalist program one step further, bringing it closer to a truly materialist
poetics.

My interests lie in books and documents as literal devices. When asked in the
context of media history, the question of literary surfaces gains an
instrumental dimension. Physical affordances of liquid crystal displays (LCDs)
and magnetic storage differ drastically from those of goat skins or parchment.
Yet surface representation maintains the illusion of self-similarity. We are
faced with what is called *skeuomorphic* design, by which the digital page
resembles print. In this way, an electronic book reader on the screen may
simulate the bent corner of a well-thumbed book. The skeuomorphic resemblance
is in itself a metaphor worthy of critical examination. The principles of
skeuomorphic design are meant to extend a visual metaphor from one medium to
another. The reader already knows how to turn pages, for example. A book device
therefore simulates pages to ease the cognitive transition to the new medium.
Instead of pushing unfamiliar buttons (yet another metaphor) to turn the page,
the reader perform the more habituated motion of swiping across the screen.

Observe however that there is nothing inherently page-like within the
electronic contraption. The metaphor conceals the structural rift between paper
and screen technology. I am concerned throughout with the particularities of
that concealment. A digital poem, a novel, a physician's script, or a legal
contract all still look like their paper counterparts, but increasingly they
behave like *gadgets*. These reading and writing *appliances* do not mediate
silently: they monitor, adjust, warn, and control.

Like the smoke alarm, literary gadgets are governed and internalize government
structures in ways that we have only begun to comprehend. The material
affordances of device--bound textuality influence all higher-level functions of
interpretation.[^ln1-rmedium] Yet, available theories of interpretation build
on properties and assumptions attached to print media. For example, in
Hans-Georg Gadamer's seminal conception of art, the free play of the artistic
mind is transformed into structure (*Gebilde*) that is both "repeatable" and
"permanent" [@gadamer_truth_1975, 110]. Similarly, in *Interpretation Theory*,
Paul Ricoeur writes about the "range of social and political changes" related
to the invention of writing. For Ricoeur, human discourse is "fixed" and
thereby "preserved from destruction" in writing [@ricur_interpretation_1976,
26-8].

The literary device offers no such permanence. It contains inscription of a
qualitatively different type. The computational reading implement, as we will
observe in detail, merely simulates a book. The engineering of literary
artifacts conceals a number of design choices, obscuring the flows of code and
codex under the familiar guise of surface representation. The digital book is
not just a book. It is a universal Turing machine, which, besides incorporating
the metaphors of reading and writing, holds the potential to enact all possible
metaphors.[^ln1-notquite] The task of the literary scholar reading on the level
of the device becomes to make the figure available for interpretation. It is to
apprehend its revealed mechanics. And, it is to ask: What happens in the
metaphorical transference between the book and the apparatus emulating the
book? Literary criticism in the sense I describe here, allows one to perceive
structures of governance: to consent, or, conversely, to resist elements of
imposed structure.

[^ln1-notquite]: To what extent a personal computer is a Turing machine is
matter of contention. The Turing machine is a *thought experiment* that
imagines a machine. The PC is a machine emulating the thought experiment. See
@putnam_representation_1988, 121-5; @chalmers_does_1996; @petzold_code:_2000. A
more detailed discussion follows in 1.2.

[^ln1-kant]: Or at least proceeding as if one has agency to structure one's own
experience, despite the overwhelming evidence for determinism.

## 1.2 Metaphor Machine

What sort of a thing is a literary device? It is tempting to think of personal
computers as glorified calculators. That is often the popular image of
computing, one that highlights the machine's ability to calculate. The computer
reduces culture to ones and zeroes (or so goes the story), thereby diminishing
the human experience.[^ln1-pop] There is some truth to that position, but I
would like to argue here that the connection between computing and calculation
is but a piece of a larger story. The personal computer governing the
production of textuality today emerged from an amalgamation of automated
equipment: among them the telegraph, the typewriter, and the calculator. Add to
that list the loom, the music box, the radio, and the film camera
[^ln1-ceruzzi]. Each of these machines left an imprint on the structure of our
everyday engagement with computational devices.

It is important to keep these intertwined material lineages in mind because
each brings with it a different set of values and priorities. As complex
computational systems continue to play an ever greater part in our lives, from
affecting family relations to health and nutrition (think social media and
personal activity trackers), we are increasingly faced with a host of
conflicting choices. When building systems that structure human experience, do
we privilege agency or efficiency, privacy or connectivity, elegance or
complexity? These are not choices that should be left to a calculator. Systems,
in themselves, do not contain values. Rather, values are imposed from without.
The question then becomes one of ends and means. A calculator is most
"efficient" when operating on binary data. Efficiency and complexity are goods
for the task of calculation. A democratic vision of a just society places value
on open deliberation and consensus building. Humans prefer to manipulate texts
and images. Undeniably, computers participate in social transformation: used to
make war and to create art. What is your machine optimized for? The passive
voice points to the root of the problem. A computational mechanism that extends
agency should embody values that correspond to the agent of the action.

To confront the computer as a *literary* device, optimized for symbolic
exchange, one must first understand its peculiar relationship to universal
Turing machines.

More than any other mechanism, the Turing machine defined the very limits of
computation. Since its inception, the Turing machine has remained a
controversial construct. At the heart of the controversy lies a paradox that
among other goings, separates the theoretical discipline of computer science
from the applied practice of electrical engineering. Turing imagined his
machine as a physical mechanism solving a theoretical problem. Actual
computers, in turn, simulate a hypothetical Turing machine. Computation
therefore emerges as a figure stuck in the loop between the ideal and the
physical worlds. It is part real mechanism and part unattainable idea.  The
indeterminacy of computation blurs the boundaries between hardware and
software. And no matter how hard computer science tries to escape into the
realm of pure mathematics, the limits of physical engineering pull it back to
the sphere of the applied.

In his seminal 1937 paper on computable numbers, Alan Turing, then a student at
King's College, did a strange thing for a mathematical journal. He imagined a
mechanism that solves a theoretical problem. What that problem was (in the
field of elementary number theory) is not as important as how he proposed to
solve it. "We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a
machine that is only capable of a finite number of conditions," he wrote
[@turing_computable_1937, 231]. Turing suggestively asked his reader to compare
computation, a human mental process, to the mechanical action of a machine. As
Charles Petzold explains in his book-length annotation on Turing's paper,
Turing "makes reference to 'states of mind' that are analogous to machine
states" [@petzold_annotated_2008, 67]. But the analogy itself is controversial.
Neither mathematicians nor cognitive scientists agree on the extent to which
states of mind can be compared to discrete machine states.

Turing further imagined a machine "supplied with a 'tape' (the analogue of
paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called 'squares') each
capable of bearing a 'symbol'" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. Much like a
movie reel, the tape moves through the machine one section at a time. At each
point only one section bearing one symbol can be said to be "in the machine."
"We may call this square the 'scanned square,'" Turing wrote,

> The symbol on the scanned square may be called the "scanned symbol." The
> "scanned symbol" is the only one of which the machine is, so to speak,
> "directly aware" [@turing_computable_1937, 231].

The scanned symbols become a part of the machine's internal configuration. In
Turing's words, "the machine can effectively remember some of the symbols which
it has 'seen' (scanned) previously" [@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The
machine's "behavior" is therefore determined by its initial configuration (in
the arrangement of tape and scanning apparatus) plus the scanned symbol. The
Turing machine is therefore a machine capable of internalizing symbolic
representation. In a sense, it transforms software (symbol) into hardware
(configuration). If the machine "reads," it reads in the Platonic sense in that
does not merely *scan over* the symbols or recite them blindly, in the way
Socrates is worried about rote recitation in *Phaedrus*. Rather it becomes
"aware." Consider by contrast the action of a film projector. Unlike a Turing
machine, the projector does not internalize film reels. The film reel leaves
nothing behind as it leaves the apparatus.[^ln1-reading]

In addition to "reading," Turing's machine must be able to write. Turing wrote
that "in some configurations in which the scanned square is blank (*i.e.* bears
no symbol) the machine writes down a new symbol on the scanned square"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231]. The machine can also erase and move symbols to
adjacent squares, one square at a time. Reading, writing, and symbolic
manipulation are thus mechanical actions at the core of Turing's computation.

The configuration of the machine determines the movement of the "reading" and
"writing" apparatus along the surface of the tape. At its simplest incarnation,
the tape moves along one dimension only: left or right. Thus some of the
scanned symbols are meant to represent computable numbers (the whole point of
Turing's paper). Yet other symbols are meant as machine instructions. They
direct the movement of the reading and writing head. They tell the machine to
"write," "scan," or "erase" symbols. Today, we would call such instructions
"programs" or "control codes." The control codes and the computed data form a
part of the same continuous stream of information.

Just as the Turing machine is able to convert symbolic representation into
internal configuration states, it can finally enact the opposite movement, by
representing internal configuration states as symbol. This remarkable property
allows for the creation of what Turing calls a class of universal machines.
Specific Turing machines could be configured to preform actions like addition
or multiplication. But the multiplication machine could not, for example, be
reconfigured for another purpose, because the physical movement of its
internals is fixed. In addition to scanning symbols, the universal Turing
machine has the ability to internalize *other machine configurations*. Turing
explains that "it is possible to invent a single machine which can compute any
computable sequence" [@turing_computable_1937, 241]. In being able to
internalize configuration as symbol, the *universal* Turing machine can
simulate all other special-purpose Turing machines.

The transition of symbols into machine states defines modern programming. A
universal machine, unlike other, definitive, single-purpose and limited-state
mechanisms (a clock for example), contains the ability to take on differing
internal symbolic configurations. It can imitate a clock, an abacus, a scale, a
book. In a later paper linking computing machinery and intelligence, Turing
implies it could eventually simulate human thought as well
[@turing_computing_1950].[^ln1-compete]

The universal Turing machine (UTM) emerges, finally, as a model of computation
itself. It can compute anything computable. Turing's "On Computable Numbers"
belongs therefore to the annals of mathematical theory. Turing's paper
continues to elicit debate because despite its mathematical language, the paper
is riddled with metaphors of cognition. The machine compares to a human in the
process of computation. Turing describes machine states in terms of "states of
mind," "awareness" and "memory." Without directly confronting the nature of
human cognition, Turing hints at the idea of computation as a model for human
thought in general. The literature on the so-called "computational theory of
mind" cites Turing's work extensively for this reason [@fodor_language_1975;
@putnam_representation_1988]. Bracketing for the moment the mathematical and
cognitive implications of Turing's work, I want to approach the Turing machine
from the perspective of a book historian and a media scholar. If the Turing
machine is to be taken at face value, not as an algorithm, but as an
instrument, what kind of a machine would it be? What are its antecedents?

Most of the minimal physical requirements to build a universal Turing machine
were within reach in the 1930s, at the time Turing authored his influential
paper. In practice, his proposal would require first, an apparatus capable of
"scanning" and "erasing" a "finite number of symbols." Second, we would need
what Turing calls "one-dimensional paper," divided into discrete squares "like
a child's arithmetic book" [@turing_computable_1937, 249].[^ln1-infinite]
Furthermore, we would need some sort of mechanism to advance tape through the
machine, or, alternatively, to propel the scanning mechanism along the length
of the tape. Having assembled these elements, our creation would look roughly
like a cross between a telegraph, a film projector, and a
typewriter.[^ln1-davey]

Were we to patent the Turing machine at the time of its theoretical inception
(1936-37) in the United States, the above elements would find prior art in
mechanisms such as the "Numeral adding or subtracting attachment for
type-writing machines" [@daugherty_numeral_1894], "Combined Type-writing and
Computing Machine" [@degener_combined_1911], "Computing Attachment for
Typewriters" [@wright_computing_1914], "Computing Mechanism"
[@wright_computing_1915], and "Combined Type-writing and Adding Machine"
[@ellis_combined_1914] among others. All of these machines contain some
combination of a reading and writing "head," storage tape, and movement
mechanism.

By the end of the nineteenth century a number of lesser contraptions anticipate
the functional elements of Turing's machine. And by 1936, when Turing publishes
his paper on computable numbers, these inventions not only anticipate the
modern computer, but are brought to mass market in the widespread manufacture
of computing scales, dial recorders, electric tabulating machines, and
computing typewriters made by companies like Underwood Computing Machine,
Electromatic, and International Business Machines (IBM). Rather than a single
eureka moment, the invention of the universal machine should be viewed as a
gradual historical process that culminates in Turing's universal (and minimally
viable) specifications.

A number of inventions at the end of the nineteenth century pertain
specifically to "circuit-controlling devices controlled by a traveling
perforated strip or tape" [@cuttriss_telegraphy_1893]. Prior to perforated
tape, the transmission of messages by telegraph required the presence of a
skilled operator, able to transcribe messages from text to Morse code, and into
the physical motion of a lever-operated circuit. In the operation of early
telegraphy, the human operator acted as a mute interpreter between text and
telegraph. The transcription of text into signal, and back onto paper, required
the real-time presence of human encoders and decoders.

The perforated tape decoupled the human from the machine. In US1187035 (1916)
on "Telegraphy", Albert and Ralph Bumstead explain: "the object of our
invention is to provide a system of telegraphy which does not require skilled
operators for the transmission and reception of messages"
[@bumstead_telegraphy_1916]. Instead, the message was transcribed into
perforation via mechanical means and then fed into the mechanism. The tape
mechanics of the typewriter could then be coupled with the electrics of the
telegraph, with perforated tape acting as a mediator between the two "worlds"
of mechanics and electricity.

A number of contraptions emerged at the time with the aim of transforming the
mechanical action of the typewriter into perforation, and, consequently,
perforation into script, completing the circuit between automated "encoding"
and "decoding." As one machine converted human input into mechanical states,
and into signal, another machine converted signals into mechanical states and
thereon into human-legible messages.

What began as a trickle at the end of the nineteenth century ended in a flood
at the beginning of the twentieth. A multitude of inventions capitalized on the
control capabilities of removable storage media. These included machines for
tape-controlled telegraphic transmission [@wheatstone_improvement_1874;
@murray_tape-controlled_1905; @bumstead_telegraphy_1916], tape-controlled
printing [@creed_printing_1911], printing telegraphs
[@hallden_printing-telegraph_1929], and remote broadcast programming devices
for radio and television content [@vriendt_program_1934; @brown_automatic_1936;
@brown_selective_1936]. With the invention of punch cards and perforated tape
(also used in textile looms, as early as 1725), a message meant for another
human became also a physical medium---bumps and holes---used to animate the
mechanical movement of the transmission apparatus.

For example, of the 33 asserted claims in the Bumstead brothers' "Telegraphy"
patent, the first 13 relate to the "transmission of intelligence,"

> [...] adapted to initiate a succession of electrical impulses all of which
> have a character representing significance, a receiver adapted to detect
> variations in time intervals elapsing between successive impulses, a
> plurality of interpreting relays selectively actuated by said receiver, and a
> printed mechanism responsive for the combined action
> [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12-13].

What begins as a description of a mechanism for information transmittal, ends
with a claim about hermeneutics of control. Starting with clause 14, the
brothers begin to describe "a telegraph system" that capable of "transmitting
impulses" at varying time intervals. In the language of the patent, the length
of the time interval "represents significance," involving an automated receiver
responsible for "distributing, interpreting, and recording." The printing
mechanism is further "arranged to print the interpretation of the signals which
is made by the interpreting relays" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 6]. The
interpreting relays transform time intervals into a "typographical form"
representing "a letter, a figure, or other characters," "in accordance with a
code" [@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 13]. Initially, the telegraph prints to
"transmit intelligence." But the authors also understand that the varying time
intervals could also signify other information, meant to actuate a variety of
devices.

By the middle of their patent, they begin to describe their telegraph as a
general "controlling medium," which can power everything from typesetting
machines to more general "sunflower switches." "Indeed the detector and the
interpreting relay could be made to actuate a set of sunflower switches for an
indicator without including a printer at all," the authors conclude
[@bumstead_telegraphy_1916, 12]. For the automated telegraph, control code and
the message are one. The mechanism interprets some signals as figure and
character and other signals as control code affecting the internal mechanical
configuration of the device. The first type of code holds "significance" for
humans, where the second for the mechanism itself. It is "transmitting
intelligence" in a sense of externalizing machine states and "interpreting" in
the sense of mechanical reconfiguration of internal parts.

Along with dozens of similar inventions patented around the turn of the
twentieth century, Bumstead brothers describe a mechanism that functions as a
Turing machine with little modification. The automated telegraph, driven by
ticker tape, and connected to a printer contain all the necessary requirements
set out by Turing: a discrete symbolic language, the removable storage medium,
and a device that can alter its internal states based on the reading and
writing of scanned symbols. Like the Turing machine, the Bumstead telegraph is
capable of recursion. Ultimately, it can produce and interpret its own control
codes.

By 1905, Donald Murray, the inventor of the popular Murray telegraph, could
write that "if we disregard the small class of telegrams that merely express
emotions, *the essence of telegraphy is control* [emphasis mine]." He went on
to write that "telegraph systems, therefore, belong not to the class of
producing or distributing, but to the class of controlling mechanisms"
[@murray_setting_1905, 556].

## 1.3 Splitting the Sign

Reading Jean Baudrillard at the end of the century prior, I understood his
writing on simulacra in relationship to ersatz entertainment: virtual reality,
reality television, and amusement parks.  Reading him today, one perceives the
pervasive nature of simulation. The machine mediates experience ubiquitously,
and the Turing machine is a universal machine simulator. It interjects in
simple everyday acts from drinking coffee in the morning (through brewing and
payment systems) to going to bed (as alarm clock and night activity monitor).
Baudrillard writes:

> At the limit of an always increasing elimination of references and finalities,
an ever-increasing loss of resemblances and designations, we find the digital
and programmatic sign, whose "value" is purely *tactical*, at the intersection
of other signals ("bits" of information/tests) whose structure is that of a
micromolecular code of command and control [@baudrillard_selected_1988, 139-140].

To rediscover the digital book device as a computational literary artifact
means coming to terms with it as as a universal Turing machine. This
immediately entails understanding the simulated nature of the electronic text.
The computer pretends to be a book. Everything that we know to be true of text
in print---from the shape of the letters to the position of text on a page, to
characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, sections, chapters, and manuscripts,
to more abstract categories like poems, novels, plays, and short stories, to
authors, styles, narratives, and discourses, in short to all textual constructs
that have their dimensions in physical space (and that is all of them), the
entire burden of literary theory---must be reconstructed again as a
*simulation*.

Furthermore, it means also gaining awareness of other simulations that are
enacted simultaneously through the device. Where a book is a just a book, the
simulated book fulfills other functions. As a universal Turing machine, the
device has the potential to conjure multiple metaphors. This means simply that
the literary artifact is also a phone, an alarm clock, a typewriter, a
surveillance system, and otherwise an instrument of governance. Its potential
to simulate other machines is unbounded.

Finally, the very metaphysical nature of Turing machines implies the
irreversible admixture of matter, content, and control. When reading a paper
and cloth book, one can definitively isolate a) the physical properties of
paper and cloth from b) the content of the book and from c) the legal and
political elements governing the production of textuality. I write "separate"
in the literal sense of recovering the blank paper, copying the content into
another medium, and removing indications of governance like the North American
ISBN numbers and notices of intellectual property. The Turing machine by
definition ingests both symbolic representation and machine control codes
through the same input stream. If you recall, Turing specifies "mental states"
of machine's "awareness" that include "scanned symbols" and "instructions for
operation." In Turing's minimally viable system, the machine sometimes reads
and remembers numbers and at other times symbols that specify the movement of
the scanning head, in actions like "erase the current cell" or "write out the
last remembered digit." Within the Turing world, which reduces all physical
mechanisms to symbols, the symbol carries with it a message of symbolic
control.

Through the ideal of a universal Turing machine, symbolism evolves into its
final and totalizing form. By converting machine states into symbols, the
Turing machine represents the ultimate negation of matter. It subsumes all
lesser mechanisms amenable to computation---which some would say includes
brains and universes.[ln1-brains] The universal Turing has the potential to
mediate everywhere, yet, paradoxically, it's method of "mediation" abstracts
from any notion of medium or intervening substance.

Under the command and control regime of the Turing machine, text loses its
adhesion to the world. Yet it would be a mistake to think of it as wholly
ethereal. The symbol itself, in its rawest form, anchors the Turing machine to
the confines of the physical universe. No matter the transcendental impulse,
the universal Turing machine cannot be abstracted beyond its minimal physical
requirements: "tape," "symbol," "scanned square," "in the machine"
[@turing_computable_1937, 231].[^ln1-inside]

A figure of computation emerges in the dual movement between symbol and
machine: the machine that pushes the symbol towards the ethereal, and the
symbol that pulls the machine back towards earth. This dynamic encapsulates the
bargain at the center of computational media and the subject of this book. The
machine frees representation from its material confines. Yet the freedom is
only simulated. Its price is the very opacity of the material context. Where
words etched in paper or stone constituted a single site for textual activity,
the digital word exists in a simulated environment physically apart from the
underlying material substratum.

The immateriality of digital media entails real-world effects: the costs of
replication plummet, for example. As a private individual, I am able to make
thousands if not millions of copies of a text without spending so much as a
dime. Hyper-reproducibility of the sort was unthinkable for most of the
twentieth century. The machine allows for rapid remediation. The lowered costs
of copying further reduce barriers to access and conveyance. Symbols that
adhere lightly to their medium are easy to store and to transport. Witness the
rise of massive, global public knowledge projects like online search engines
and encyclopedias as a direct consequence. Such projects unfold the logic of
immateriality, which moves towards totalizing archives and universal
accessibility.[^ln1-google] Under the conditions where representation weighs
nothing, one imagines a weightless totality of all representation, available
immediately and everywhere.

The percieved weightlessness of text has other side-effects which we will
explore throughout the book. For example, a text that adheres lightly to its
medium is also difficult to contain, making onerous the governance of symbolic
representation. Traditional controls like censorship and intellectual property
rights become difficult to sustain.

Yet, despite the appearances, the sign does not and cannot exist in a vacuum.
Rather, the symbol splits in two: with one half arising visibly, a weightless
and apparent screen simulation, and the other half, opaque, etched into the
hefty and hidden material contingencies of the device.

Thus when when Michael Heim refers to the "ephemeral quality" of the electronic
text or when Pamela McCorduck describes it as "impermanent, flimsy, malleable,
[and] contingent" they are both identifying real-world technological
affordances of simulated screen textuality [@mccorduck_universal_1985, 51;
@heim_electric_1987, 211]. McCorduck tells the story of a rabbinate court,
which, when faced with the law prohibiting observant Jews from erasing God's
name, rule that words on "screens, disks, and tapes" are not to be considered
as writing, therefore sanctioning erasure [@mccorduck_universal_1985, 51; also
quoted @heim_electric_1987, 192]. Other technological and legal fictions arise
to restore a measure of "stickiness" to electronic media.  For example,
manufacturers commonly embed digital rights management circuits into video
streaming devices to artificially limit the duplication of broadcast material.
Similarly, electronic book sellers usually disable the reader's ability to copy
and paste from the material. Such measures mimic some of the constraints
associated with static, paper-and-ink media regimes.

When scholars like Johnna Drucker, Katherine Hayles, and Matthew Kirschenbaum
respond to Heim and company with hardened materialism, they are also rightly
identifying actual properties of electronic text. But the two camps speak
neither of the same phenomenon nor at the same site. The former group points to
the screen as the impermanent and ephemeral state of the written word: like
tomatoes suspended in aspic, writes Heim [@heim_electric_1987, ix]. The latter
points instead to the "uniquely indelible nature of magnetic storage"
[@kirschenbaum_mechanisms_2008], to "drives, tapes, and disks" as the
"fundamental physical support" and "material substrates of computing"
[@drucker_performative_2013]. Both locations, the screen and the disk, are
real. Neither can be reduced to the other. Both contain distinct constraints
and affordances for action.

The material substrates of computational text likewise carry real-world
affordances and consequences. They are first and foremost hidden from view.
Drives and tapes reside inside of black or aluminum boxes. If only because they
carry electrical current and have the potential to catch fire, they are heavily
regulated. They contain heavy and rare metals, often hazardous if touched or
ingested. The computational part of the sign is sealed in miniaturized
containers that prevent access and to resist tempering. These are but some of
the realities of material text. It is text intertwined with machine internals
and control code and it is often hermeneutically sealed to resist human
interpretation.

The bifurcated sign resides in two distinct locations, each entailing
drastically differing affordances for reading.

## 1.4 Rise of Simulated Text

To see the universal Turing machine as a book---an instrument for symbolic
exchange---means to recover the physical roots of computation.  When viewed in
the context of book history, the universal Turing machine signifies a
consummation of several broad, long-term trends that begin with the invention
of writing itself. The God of the Hebrew Bible etched his commandments into
stone (Exodus 34:1). Moses broke the first set of tablets, but the word
remained, for a time, immutable. The material history of literary computing
begins with petrified words that endure forever, and ends with word as an
electrical charge: animated, radiant, fluid, and iridescent
[@mcgann_radiant_2001; @bryant_fluid_2002].

The long history of the word proceeds in stages, from the immutable sign to the
universal implement, capable of reproducing all symbolic representation
dynamically. The universal Turing machine culminates the development of the
symbol. Through it, the symbol gains its ideal form, capable of representing
everything that can be represented. All further symbolic engines constitute
lesser versions of the universal archetype.[^ln1-brain] Yet the archetype
machine itself is also limited to an ideal. It can only exist as a thought
experiment. All real-world Turing machines must contain non-representational
elements, dispelling the illusion of immateriality.

Although much of contemporary popular discourse on computation speaks the
language of disruption, the history of computational symbolism, of the sort I
am suggesting here, must be seen as an evolutionary trajectory.

If a symbol, something used to represent something else, elicits a type of an
illusion, the universal symbolic machine enacts the ultimate illusion. It
creates a phantasmal image of symbolism itself. The history of computing is
thus a history of symbolism in the broadest possible meaning of the word, which
includes lyric poetry and symbolic logic. That history begins with the human
capacity to externalize images. It proceeds with the invention of writing: a
formal constraint on the image, adding a level of non-mimetic abstraction. A
picture of the horse that looks like a horse can now be represented in five
characters that can further be recombined to form other images. The constraint
on the number of symbolic "building blocks" proceeds with the diffusion of
movable type in China and Europe, circa 1040 (China) and 1450 (Germany)
[@mcluhan_gutenberg_1962; @he_diffusion_1994; @needham_shorter_1994, 1-34;
@febvre_coming_2010].

With the invention of movable type and the typewriter, the variability of
hand-written script was further normalized to a set of discrete and
reproducible characters.[^ln1-normal] A key stipulation for the Turing machine
requires that "the number of symbols which can be printed is finite"
[@turing_computable_1937, 249]. The mechanization of print begins to "lift" the
letter from its medium, enabling the development of distant writing
(telegraphy) and remote communications, which, although extant in many early
societies (as smoke and mirror signals, for example) accelerates dramatically
at the beginning of the nineteenth century [@shaffner_telegraph_1859;
@beauchamp_history_2001; @standage_victorian_2014]. When combined with the
mechanization of type, telegraphy amplifies the range and the speed of
geographical displacement enabled by the circulation of printed matter. I do
not pause much for these developments because they are well described in the
literature.

Finally, the rise of universal Turing machines in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries definitely severs the symbol from its material contexts.
Textuality splits into simulated surface representation and underlying control
code. Computation changes the nature of print from an intelligence-conveying
medium to one of communication and control. "Content" intended for humans is
now routinely mixed with "control codes" intended to alter the operation of the
receiving device. The Turing machine achieves the bifurcation of the sign,
intertwining the histories of telecommunications and code control. A
computational document or a book arises as a subset of control devices: the
essence of distant writing is control.

As we embark to explore the consequences of simulated text, I propose we keep
the following three landmark mechanisms in view as signpost along our journey:
Goldberg's Controller, the IBM MT/ST, and Engelbart's Time Fob. In the first of
these, text structure and machine control lie before us for inspection. The
second one is mute: a black slate. The last of these belongs to what Peter
Denning calls the "third generation" of computer systems---an assemblage of
storage, input, and output technologies that continue to shape the contemporary
human encounter with text today. These devices tell us a story of the fracture.
Through them, a part of the sign fades from view as an arrangement of magnetic
charge and floating gate. Another part appears as flicker of the cathode ray
and the flow of the liquid crystal.

### A. Removable storage media and automation, 1725--1964.[^ln1-loom]

"You must acknowledge that this is readable without special training," reads
the schematic illustration to a Goldberg 1911 patent, simply titled
"Controller." "My invention relates to all controllers," Goldberg writes.
Furthermore, the object of his invention is "to provide a mechanism operable by
a control sheet which is legible to every person having sufficient education to
enable him to read." Goldberg illustrates his invention in attaching to his
patent "a control sheet in which the control characters are in the form of the
letters of the ordinary English alphabet"  [@goldberg_controller_1915]. Rather
than using ticker tape, Goldberg uses perforations that form letters. On
Goldberg's control sheets, the language of machines and the language of humans
coincide.

![Goldberg's Control Cards [@goldberg_controller_1915].](images/control-2.png)

The Controller never caught on, but the patent makes it clear that Goldberg,
among others, was aware of the problem: the mechanization of type, automation,
and remote control required specialized training. With the advent of the
automated telegraph, content meant for people was now being intermixed with
machine-controlling code. To combat mutual unintelligibility, Goldberg imagines
using cards, perforated in the shape of the English alphabet. Besides carrying
(human-readable) content, the perforations do "double duty" to mechanically
manipulate the machine's "blocks," "handles," "terminal blades," and "plungers"
[@goldberg_controller_1915]. Early paper-based storage media, from Morse
code-based ticker tape systems, to the telegraphs of Hughes and Baudot, and to
punch cards that powered weaving looms, player pianos, and census tabulators
coupled message and control. The era of ticker tape punch cards can be thought
to end with the mass-market introduction of IBM's Magnetic Tape/Selectric
Typewriter in 1964.

### B: Magnetic tape, 1888--1968

"Historically unforeseen, barely a thing, software's ghostly presence produces
and defies apprehension," Wendy Chun writes in her *Programmed Visions*, an
influential monograph that continues to shape the field of software studies.
She quotes several prominent computer scientists and media historians to the
same effect. But what gives software its ephemeral quality? Embossed onto
ticker tape or punched into the card, early software protrudes through the
medium. In the age of the telegraph, the largest barrier to the comprehension
of software was encoding. But once the cipher is known and the format
identified, the inscription makes itself visible to view. Early programmable
media could hardly be called ephemeral or immaterial. Anecdotes circulate in
the digital humanities circles of Father Roberto Busa, an early (post-WWII)
pioneer in the field of computational philology, carting his punch cards around
Italy on a truck.[^ln3-busa] Code before its electromagnetic period was
burdensome, fragile, unwieldy, and, most of all, visible.

Typewriter (MC/ST) in 1969. "A simple relationship could be maintained between
a typed page and a recorded card" [@may_ibm_1981, 744]. Image by Pointillist
under GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2.](images/ibm-card.png)

The principles of magnetic recording were developed by Oberlin Smith (among
others), the American engineer who also filed several inventions related to
weaving looms at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1888, inspired by
Edison's mechanical phonograph, Smith made public his experiments with an
"electrical method" of sound recording using a "magnetized cord" (cotton mixed
with hardened steel dust) as a recording medium. These experiments were later
put into practice by Valdemar Poulsen of Denmark, who patented several
influential designs for a magnetic wire recorder [@smith_possible_1888;
@poulsen_method_1900; @engel_1888-1988_1988; @thiele_magnetic_1988;
@daniel_magnetic_1998; @vasic_coding_2004].

In 1964, IBM combined magnetic tape storage with its *Selectric* line of
electric typewriters, introducing the Magnetic Tape Selectric (MT/ST) line of
typewriters to the mass market. Writing for the *Encyclopedia of Library and
Information Science* in 1992, Daniel Eisenberg mentions the MT/ST as one of the
first word processors, defined by the ability to record strokes and to print
them onto paper *as a separate operation* [@eisenberg_word_1992]. The
separation of input and output allows for word processing as such. An article
in the *IBM Journal for Research and Development* explains that the real
significance of the MT/ST workstation was in the introduction of new "power
typing" technologies: "For the first time the typist could type at 'rough
draft' speed, 'backspace and strike over' errors, and not worry about the
pressure of mistakes made at the end of the page" [@may_ibm_1981, 742].

We may think of word processing as a temporal extension of the page. Words on
magnetic storage media begin to exist in the ephemeral state, giving the typist
an opportunity to edit and emend *before* commitment to paper, in its immutable
form, and as a separate operation, removed from the immediate process of
inscription. The very invention of word processing thus corresponds to the
decline of text into ephemera. What was visible through a hole punch on ticker
tape, was now submerged into tape. The tape no longer afforded human legibility
nor comprehension. Encoding used by MT/ST retained the familiar (from the
earlier sections) underlying structure (7-bit encoding, in this case) which, on
tape, ceased to be recoverable by the naked eye. The inscription lay literally
beyond (human) sense. We lack the perceptual apparatus to perceive "magnetic
domains" and "polarities"[^ln3-magnet] that take place of visible alphabets.
Magnetic storage remains, for all unassisted intents and purposes, a black
slate.

### C: Screen, 1968--today

By decoupling input and output, magnetic storage and solid state media afford
the injection of time and space, in arbitrary intervals, between the process of
inscription and comprehension. Content, coupled with control code, sinks
beneath the matte surface of electrical charge. The final movement in the
emergence of automated discourse reintroduces the illusion of immediacy into
the process of inscription. Text, invisible in its material substratum,
reappears on the screen, but, crucially, it no longer corresponds to its mirror
inscription. This property is as perilous as it is liberating: perilous,
because the flows of power and control can now be submerged under the
shimmering surface of the screen, and liberating, because loosely coupled to
their material substratum texts become both more fluid and more portable.
Plainly put, the systematic barriers to copying, sharing, exchanging, editing,
remixing, and disseminating texts are reduced to a minimum.

Ersatz skeuomorphism (between disk storage and screen image) leads to the
reception of digital text as an ephemeral artifact. With the illusory role of
the screen in mind, I propose 1968 as the year in which the contemporary
textual condition takes its present form. On December 9, 1968 Douglas
Engelbart, then founder and primary investigator at the NASA- and ARPA-funded
Augmentation Research Center lab at the Stanford Research Institute, gave what
later became known colloquially as "the mother of all demos
[@tweney_mother_2008]" before an audience of roughly one thousand or so
computer professionals attending the Fall Joint Computer Conference held at the
Convention Center in San Francisco [@rogers_demo_2005]. The demo announced the
arrival of almost every technology prophesied by Vannevar Bush in his
influential 1945 piece for *The Atlantic* [@bush_as_1945]. Speaking a little
over an hour,  through a headset, in a prerecorded address, Engelbart features
functional (live) prototypes of the following: graphical user interfaces, video
conferencing, remote camera monitoring, links and hypertext, version control,
text search, image manipulation, windows-based user interfaces, digital slides,
networked machines, mouse, stylus, and joystick inputs, and "what you see is
what you get" (WYSIWYG) word processing.

!["NOW IS THE TIME FOB." Schematics for a "display system"
[@engelbart_x-y_1970].](images/engel.png)

In his report to NASA, which sponsored research on "intellect augmentation"
along with DARPA, Engelbart describes his lab as a group of scientists
"developing an experimental laboratory around an interactive, multiconsole
computer-display system" and "working to learn the principles by which
interactive computer aids can augment the intellectual capability of the
subjects" [@engelbart_human_1969, 1]. Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays were
central to this research mission. In one of many patents that came out of
"intellect augmentation" laboratory, Engelbart pictures the "display system" as
a workstation that combines a typewriter, a CRT, and a mouse. The system is
frozen in mid-action, with the words "THE TIME IS NOW FOB" prominently
displayed on the screen. Although Engelbart does not explain the message, the
system's user is evidently in the process of editing a sentence and about to
correct the nonsensical FOB into a FOR. Engelbart writes, "One of the
potentially most promising means for delivering and receiving information to
and from digital computers involves the display of computer outputs as visual
representation on a cathode ray tube and the alternation of the display by
human operator in order to deliver instructions to the computer"
[@engelbart_x-y_1970].

The CRT closes the circuit between human and machine, with a few caveats. In
practice, the short-lived screen-less word processors (like the IBM MT/ST)
necessitated for the cognitively arduous task of continuously keeping the
underlying document structure in the mind's eye. The CRT lifts that burden by
unfolding the structure topographically, allowing for spatial navigation along
the document---restoring, in a sense, the natural affordances of print. Data
becomes visible again. Moreover, represented in the shimmer of the cathode ray,
it attaches itself lightly to the retina. Users trying out this way of writing
for the first time report that the screen liberates them from the material
confines of print textuality. One user, possibly Engelbart himself, writes the
following:[^ln3-follow]

[^ln3-follow]: I reproduce the text verbatim and preserving the line breaks,
since formatting is an important part of the reported experience.

```
    1B2B1 "To accommodate and preserve a thought or
    piece of information that isn't related to the work
    of the moment, one can very quickly and easily
    insert a note within the structure of a file at such
    a place that it will nether get in the way nor get
    lost.

    1B2B2 "Later, working in another part of the file,
    he can almost instantly (e.g. within two seconds)
    return to the place where he temporarily is storing
    such notes, to modify or add to any of them.

    1B2B3 "As any such miscellaneous thought develops,
    it is easy (and delightful) to reshape the structure
    and content of its discussion material.
```

Engelbart, interested in collecting empirical phenomenological accounts of the
system, records what must count as several of the most evocative passages to
appear on the pages of a NASA technical report. In the "Results and Discussion"
section an anonymous user continues to report:

```
1B4 "I find that I can express myself better, if I can
make all the little changes and experiments with wording
and structure as they occur to me." [Here the user
experiments a little with using structural decomposition
of a complex sentence.]
```

A deconstruction indeed follows, as the author begins to deviate from the
conventions of the technical report. The numbered passages, and unexpected
enjambment, heightens the staccato quality of the prose, which at times reaches
towards the lyric:


```
    1B4A "I find that I write faster and more freely,

        1B4A1 "pouring thoughts and trial words on the
        screen with much less inhibition,

        1B4A2 "finding it easy to repair mistakes or wrong
        choices

            1B4A22 "so while capturing a thought I don't
            have to inhibit the outpouring of thought and
            action to do it with particular correctness,

        1B4A3 "finding that several trials at the right
        wording can be done very quickly

            1B4A3A "so I can experiment, easily take a look
            and see how a new version strikes me--and often
            the first unworried attempt at a way to express
            something turn out to be satisfactory, or at
            least to require only minor touch up.

        1B4A4 "Finding that where I might otherwise
        hesitate in search of the right word, I now pour out
        a succession of potentially appropriate words,
        leaving them all the while the rest of the
        statement takes shape. Then I select from among
        them, or replace them all, or else merely change the
        list a it and wait for a later movement of the
        spirit.
```

When input and output coincide in time, as they do on paper, mistakes can be
costly. The writer must commit to making an inscription and, once made, the
inscription gains permanence in a way that is difficult to correct. One can
erase, removing a layer of physical material, or cover up, adding a layer of
white ink to repair the damage. Engelbart's anonymous writer reports a feeling
of freedom from such commitment to physical medium. He or she can simply
"backspace" and start over. The contemporary reader may take such things for
granted now, but imagine trying to write in that way for the first time.
Writing "comes easy," becomes "uninhibited," and it "pours out" experimentally.
Rather than manipulate language mentally, the writer "pours" the words onto the
screen and then "selects" the right one, without hesitation. The highly
hierarchical and blocky paragraph structure, along with its repetitive refrain,
"finding" and "I find that," gives the prose a hypnotic drive forward, which
matches the reported experience of liberation. Anonymous continues:

```

The passages are too contrived to be spontaneous admissions of phenomenological
experience. Despite the experimental structure, the passages contain a
well-formed rhetorical message advancing key elements of Engelbart's research
program, which aimed to develop new data structures in combination with new
ways of displaying them. Yet I cannot help but be carried away by the fluency
of the prose and by the sheer audacity of the project. Here's someone who has
not only glimpsed the future, but has also brought it into being. The
contemporary author can drag and drop passages around with more facility, but
he has not himself structured his cognitive environment. In Engelbart's terms,
someone else has augmented the author's intellect, in ways that may or may not
fit the individual psyche. That feeling of effortless textuality cannot
therefore be taken at face value, by the unreliable phenomenological accounts
alone. To bring his system into being, Engelbart convened what he called a
"bootstrap community," which through recursive self-improvement could lift
itself up towards a smarter, more efficient, and as the report's lexicon
betrays, a more human way of working. To accomplish this, the group crafted
novel instruments for input and output. They wrote new programming languages,
compilers to interpret them, and debuggers to troubleshoot. They invented word
editors and format control languages. Here's how Engelbart diagrams a *part* of
his text-manipulation language in the same report:

!["State--chart portrayal of part of text--manipulation control language"
[@engelbart_human_1969, 36].](images/engel-edit.png)

The diagram shows much attention to the detail of and love for the writing
craft. But there is also much complexity. It is near impenetrable. In building
their own tools, Engelbart's team lifted themselves up by the bootstraps. But
it was not the machine that lifted them up---it was the process of creating the
machine. The very metaphor of bootstrapping suggests the impossibility of using
one's bootstraps to pull others out of the Platonic cave. As a side effect of
that effort, text, before readily apparent on the page, now enters a complex
system of executable code and control structure. The perception of material
lightness of textual being comes at the price of legibility. Would new authors
find the same ease in the complication of the mechanism? I suspect not unless
they become an active part of a "bootstrapping community" of their own.

[^ln1-brain]: We will later entertain the (real) possibility of
non-representational communication, suggested by early experiments in direct
brain-to-brain or brain-to-machine interfaces.

## 1.6 WYSINAWYG (What You See Is Not Always What You Get)

I do not trust the text appearing before my eyes. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun calls
magnetic storage the "enduring ephemeral," which "creates unforeseen
degenerative links between humans and machines" [@chun_enduring_2008, 148]. If
the floating gate transistor,[^ln1-gate] where my text now lives, can be called
the enduring ephemeral, I will call my liquid crystal display, where the text
shows itself, fading persistence. This is not to believe that text on the
screen lacks materiality. Not at all. Only that it seems to drift from surface
to surface, beyond the field of vision, in ways that erode trust in the general
permanence of the literary system. If we are destined to dwell on surfaces, I
do not know to which surface to attach my attention: the screen or the floating
gate.

I have before me at least two inscriptions: one as circuit state on my hard
drive, and another as crystal phase on the screen. They denote the same idea,
but in two distinct places. How did this duplicity come to be? And what impact
does it have on the life of a mind? In an attempt to answer, I offer the
following three historical preconditions for digital textuality. They are not
meant as history, but rather as signposts to mark the journey ahead. The schema
proceeds roughly as follows: first, content and control couple at the visible
surface of removable storage media (ticker tape and punch card); second,
inscription splits into input and output, retreating into magnetic storage to
reemerge at last on screen, in the same guise, but also, as we suspect, somehow
transformed: less solid and concealing something beneath the phantasmal shell
of its former appearance.[^ln1-denning]

Where does text reside? If you are reading this book in print, you can point to
the page and be fairly certain of the answer: here, on the page. If you are
reading the book on a *device*, things get more complicated. You can point to
the screen and yet it would not be enough to say that the text resides there.
The screen will go dark when the device loses power, but the text will
persevere within, stored at another physical location. Deep within a device,
the text will be embedded into some sort of a storage medium, usually a
magnetic or a "solid state" drive. Where the digital text resides affects even
those who prefer to read in print. Like most literature today, print materials
are also "born digital." At some point of time, they occupy the same
duplicitous position between storage medium and pixel.

Few readers today will be able to give an account of a pixel's passage from
keystroke to ink or pixel. The vast machinery that brings literature to life
hides from the reader's view. Literature conceals. Even on the level of
stylistics, writing well is meant to evoke a sense of ease where it is usually
the product of painstaking labor. Let us hold on to that intuition for the
duration of this chapter: writing conceals labor.

Much is at stake in the material affordances of the literary artifact. The
political struggle for meaning-making, that is, the very opportunity to engage
in the act of interpretation, begins with the text as a material object. In the
West, it is easy to forget the blunt effectiveness of physical control. Books
that are burned or locked up cannot be read at all. Global inequities of access
to knowledge are much more obvious in the post-colonial world, where readers
print their own books and build their own libraries to preserve access. Witness
the so-called "shadow libraries" of Eastern Europe [@tenen_book_2014,
@bodo_short_2014], the street book vendors of India and Pakistan
[@mahmood_copyright_2005, @liang_piracy_2009], and the *samizdat* press of
Nigeria under the conditions that have been described as "book famine"
[@okiy_photocopying_2005, @nkiko_book_2014]. Yet despite the hardship, these
practices are at least engaged in the proactive preservation of the literary
sphere. Shadow libraries erect architectures of knowledge and create reading
publics who own the means of textual diffusion. They make copies, write server
software that aids in the distribution, and build archives.
Elsewhere---here---such infrastructures are created for us. Consequently, they
disappear from view. If indeed my intuition is correct and readers do not know
what books are, how they are made, or what they are capable of, we are all
operating under the conditions of profound alienation.

I want to foreshadow now what will become the punchline of the whole book:
namely that the ghost in the machine cannot be reduced to some vague notions of
value---these amount to a distraction, which lies plainly upon the surface. The
conspicuous ghostly apparition (indicating the absence of a living subject) is
agency itself, which, for now, necrotically attaches itself to dead things like
systems, mediums, and automated discourses. If all this talk of value, ghosts,
and necromancy sounds familiar, the reader will not be surprised when I advance
Karl Marx as a preeminent theorist of the algorithm and someone able to help us
reason through Kittler's computational conundrum. On towards Marx then (who
will appear much later), through the machine that, although intimately familiar
to every writer and consumer of text by touch, remains alien and alienating in
its hidden possibilities, soothing and threatening all at once.

If you are reading these words on a screen, my message has reached you through
a long chain of transformations: from the mechanical action of my keyboard, to
the arrangement of electrons on magnetic storage media, to the modulation of
fiber-optic signal, to the shimmer of the flowing liquid crystal. Many, many
third parties were involved in that act of communication. And some part of that
message was used to control the electrical circuits of the device in your lap,
in your hand, near to your eye, embedded, or embodied. Close reading limited to
the parsing of content and representation risks missing the machinations of
naked circuit control. It looks like you are reading a book, but this book
changes its internals as it receives instructions to inform and to control. For
now I ask only, Who controls the machine? But were a book also a pill or fused
with the neural circuitry of the brain, would you know what and whom you were
reading?

[^ln1-translate]: "In our discussion of this text we have been using an
authoritative French translation of Plato, the one published by Guillaume Bude.
In the case of *Phaedrus*, the translation is by Leon Robin. We will continue to
refer to it, inserting Greek text in parenthesis [@derrida_dissemination_1981,
71]."

[^ln1-rmedium]: For example, see Paul Ricoeur writing on the change in media
from speaking to writing: "The most obvious change from speaking to writing
concerns the relation between message and its medium or channel. At first
glance, it concerns only this relation, but upon closer examination, the first
alteration irradiates in every direction, affecting in decisive manner all the
factors and functions" [@ricur_interpretation_1976, 25].

[^ln1-formal]: I discuss the idea of form as structure and sound in greater
detail in Chapter 3.

[^ln1-gurevich]: Kittler mistakingly attributes "Algorithms in the World of
Bounded Resources" to Brosl Hasslacher. The author is rather Yuri Gurevich,
Principle Researcher at Microsoft Research and then a professor at the
University of Michigan. Hasslacher's essay entitled "Beyond the Turing Machine"
appeared in the same volume of collected essays, @herken_universal_1988.

[^ln1-bottom]: For example, in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of
communication, the top-most layer of protocols and interface method is called
the "application layer" and the bottom-most layer the "physical layer"
[@peterson_computer_2007, 26-28]. Timothy Colburn and Gary Shute describe it as
being "responsible for encoding bits onto a transmission medium, whether wires,
fiber optics, or radio broadcast, in ways that maximize the transmission rate
and minimize sensitivity to noise [@colburn_abstraction_2007, 181].

[^ln1-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
matter, what we regard as computer instructions, and consequently what we
regard as computer programs, is determined by computers available," he writes
[@moor_three_1978, 215]. Nurbay Irmark argues that software is instead a purely
abstract artifact, akin to a musical work [@irmak_software_2012]. See also
@turner_programming_2013; @colburn_software_1999.

[^ln1-turing]: The intellectual history of the Turing machine is well
established, in multiple works on the subject. It follows the Greek Diophantus,
René Descartes, Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell,
Kurt Gödel, Ludwig Wittgenstein [@petzold_annotated_2008;
@herken_universal_1988; @grattan-guinness_development_1981].

[^ln1-alt]: "We have to think (in a completely novel way) the relation between
a science and the ideology [...] the fact that such an investigation confronts
us with the observation that every science, in the relationship it has with
ideology it emerged from, can only be thought as a 'science of ideology, would
disconcert us, were we not forewarned of the name of the *object* of knowledge,
which can only exist in the form of ideology" [@althusser_reproduction_2014,
46].

[^ln1-derr]: See @derrida_writing_1978. I am alluding particularly to
statements like "ethnology-like any science-comes about within the element of
discourse," and "this moment was that in which language invaded the universal
problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything
became discourse-provided we can agree on this word-that is to say, when
everything became a system where the central signified, the original or
transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of
differences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and
the interplay of signification ad infinitum" (278-294).

[^ln1-flip]: There is a long-standing joke in Marxist literature that involves
flipping Hegel, who prioritized the transcendent spiritual over the physical
and material forms of life, over "back to his feet." See for example
@marx_marx-engels_1978: "The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making
a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common,
every-day thing, wood. But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is
changes into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feed on the
ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and
evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than
'table-turning' ever was" (320). See also @engels_ludwig_1941: "Thereby the
dialectic of the concept itself became merely the conscious reflex of the
dialectical motion of the real world and the dialectic of Hegel was placed upon
its head; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing before, and
placed on its feet again" (44).

[^ln1-dirt]: Think of text as substance and literature as surface. The first is
like dirt where the second is gound. We play with one on top of the other.

[^ln1-gate]: Solid state memory technology, flash memory for example, store
information in capacitor "circuit states." This by contrast with
electromagnetic storage that works by modulating electrical charge over a
magnetic surface. Solid state capacitor storage was used in the earliest
computers [@kahng_semipermanent_1967, 1296], but was prohibitively expensive to
manufacture until well into the twenty-first century, when solid state drives
began to replace electromagnetic storage in consumer electronics. In an early
(1967) paper on "A Floating Gate and Its Application to Memory Devices," Kahng
and Sze explain: "A structure has been proposed and fabricated in which
semipermanent charge storage is possible. A floating gate is placed a small
distance from an electron source. When an appropriately high field is applied
through an outer gate, the floating gate charges up. The charges are stored
even after the removal of the charging field due to much lower back transport
probability [...] Such a device functions as a bistable memory with
nondestructive read-out features. The memory holding time observed was longer
than one hour" [@kahng_floating_1967, 1288]. See also @horton_experimental_1962
and @frohman-bentchkowsky_fully_1971 on "floating gate avalanche injection."

[^ln1-denning]: These stages correspond roughly to the "three generations of
electronic computing" outlined in Peter Denning's "theory of operating systems"
[@denning_third_1971].
