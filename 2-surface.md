# Chapter 2: Surface

`inscription, encoding, legibility`

## Intro

I do not trust the text appearing before my eyes. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun calls
magnetic storage the "enduring ephemeral," which "creates unforeseen
degenerative links between humans and machines" [@chun_enduring_2008, 148]. If
the floating gate transistor,[^ln1-gate] where my text now lives, can be called
the enduring ephemeral, I will call my liquid crystal display, where the text
shows itself, fading persistence. This is not to believe that digital text can
transcend its material contexts. Only that it seems to drift from surface to
surface, beyond the field of vision, in ways that erode trust in the general
permanence of the literary system. If we are destined to dwell on surfaces, I
do not know to which surface to attach my attention: the screen or the floating
gate.

In Chapter One of *Plain Text*, we encountered the book as a device. I traced
the intellectual roots of the literary artifact to several ideas emerging at
the turn of the twentieth century. We saw it first as a formal device: a
technique for defamiliarizing or making strange habituated metaphors. We then
saw it as a literal device, related to the operation of universal Turing
machines. Finally, I argued that Turing machines themselves belong to the
history of the book, both in the lineage of thought about symbolic
interpretation and as mechanisms for their transmission.

Once we see the digital document in all of its forms for what it is, a
computational device, we can begin to come to terms with the simulated nature
of screen textuality. Ask yourself a simple question: Where does text reside?
In print, one can point to the page and be fairly certain of the answer: here,
on the page. Computation complicates matters significantly. One can point to
the screen, yet it would not be enough to say that the text *is* there. The
screen remains in flux. It is a site of temporary projection. The projection
emanates from the storage medium within, passing through multiple filters and
transformations on the way to the screen. We therefore observe the figure
stretch before us across at least two sites of inscription. The sign stretches
and splits, expressed in the configuration of magnetic pulse and circuit state
at one end and in the phases of liquid crystal on screen at the other. Both
locations afford distinct constraints to reading, writing, and interpretation.

Thus when Michael Heim refers to the "ephemeral quality" of the electronic text
or when Pamela McCorduck describes it as "impermanent, flimsy, malleable, [and]
contingent" they identify real-world attributes of digital inscription, at the
site of its projection. McCorduck tells the story of a rabbinate court, which,
when faced with the law prohibiting observant Jews from erasing God's name,
rule that words on the screen are not to be considered as writing, therefore
sanctioning erasure [@mccorduck_universal_1985, 51; also quoted
@heim_electric_1987, 192]. Conversely, when scholars like Johnna Drucker,
Katherine Hayles, and Matthew Kirschenbaum respond to Heim and company with
hardened materialism, they are also rightly describing properties of digital
inscription, but this time at the site of its archival immanence. The two camps
disagree because they speak neither of the same phenomenon nor at the same
site. The former group notices the ephemeral, transcendent state of the
projected word. The latter points instead to the "uniquely indelible nature of
magnetic storage" [@kirschenbaum_mechanisms_2008], to "drives, tapes, and
disks" as the "fundamental physical support" and "material substrates of
computing" [@drucker_performative_2013]. The hard drive and the screen
partition the sign between surface and depth, projection and archive.

Form and content lie flat on the printed page. Print interfaces are paper thin,
we might say. Ink adheres to paper in the way that pixels do not to screens.
The splintered sign complicates the traditional structuralist distinctions
between form and content. It occupies at least two distinct sites, each
entailing drastically differing accordances for reading, writing, and
interpretation. Were we to untangle the tightly wound coil of the circuit, we
would find ample distance between the hard drive and the screen. Where print is
flat, computed text resides at several levels and along multiple dimensions
[@halyes code is flat].

How did this multiplicity come to be? And what effect does it have on the life
of the mind? The purpose of this chapter is to open space between the visible
sign and the archived inscription. The structure of textual artifacts---from a
simple leaflet to a novel in multiple volumes---has remained remarkably stable
since the invention of movable type. One rarely finds a sentence that spans
several paragraphs, for example. Nor would a contemporary reader expect to find
pages of different length in the same tome. Long-standing historical
conventions guide the production of printed text. Semantic and decorative units
on a page exist within a strict hierarchy, so familiar to us as to become
almost invisible. No book of serious non-fiction will be typeset in cursive
font, for example. But unless something out of the ordinary attracts attention,
the reader will tend to gloss the "inconsequential" details of formatting in
favor of content. The material contexts of a well designed book fade from view
during reading.

For a few decades after the advent of magnetic storage media but before screen
technology, the outward shape of the sign disappeared altogether. It is
difficult to fathom now, but at the time after the introduction of magnetic
tape in the 1960s but before the wide-spread advent of cathode ray tube
displays in the 1980s, the typewriter operator and the computer programmer were
often expected to manipulate text blindly. Where the page or the punch card
gave immediate visual feedback, the combination of magnetic tape and screen
separated input from output. The word could be "processed" or altered with
codes that controlled attributes like indent size or justification *before*
committing ink to paper. A paper describing the popular IBM Magnetic Tape
Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST) introduced in 1964 describes the novelty of the
system as follows:

> It could be emphasized for the first time that the typist could type at
> "rough draft" speed, "backspace and strike over" errors, and not worry about
> the pressure of mistakes made at the end of the page [@may_ibm_1981, 742].

The IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC) further added a "programmable
control" unit to separate the input from the output. Final printing would be
accomplished by:

> mounting the original tape and the correction tape, if any, on the
> two-station reader output unit, setting the pitch, leading, impression
> control and dead key space of the composer unit to the desired values, and
> entering set-up instructions on the console control (e.g., one-station or
> two-station tape read, depending on whether the correction tape is present;
> line count instructions for the format control and space to be left for
> pictures, etc.; special format instructions; and any required control codes
> known to be omitted from the input tape. During printing, the operator
> changes type elements when necessary, loads paper as required, and makes and
> enters hyphenation decisions if justified copy is being printed
[@bishop_development_1968, 382].

The tape unit and the control unit thus intervene between the keyboard and the
printed page. The "final printing" combines roughly the "prepared copy" with
"control and reference codes" and "printer output" [@bishop_development_1968;
@may_ibm_1981]. The materials from the time often speak of three distinct human
operators that could be responsible for each stage of the production: one
entering the copy, one specifying the control codes, and one responsible for
handling the paper output. The machine operators could hypothetically work in
isolation from one another. The typist would see only elements of the copy; the
typesetter or the controller only formatting and control codes; and the printer
only the interpolated results.

!["Block diagram of MT/SC system [@bishop_development_1968, 381].](images/mt-sc.png)

Researchers working on these early IBM word processing machines saw the
separation of print into such distinct strata as one of their major
contributions to the history of print writ large. A consultant writing for the
*IBM Journal* in 1968 imagines the "evolution of composition" that proceeded
from handwriting, to wood engraving, movable type, letterpress, and, finally,
to the IBM MT/SC. "The IBM Selectric Composer provides a new approach to the
printing process in this evolution," he writes. He concludes to say that the
IBM Composer finally empowers the writer to once again write books "without the
assistance of specialists" [@frutiger, 10]. Marketing language aside, the
separation of the sign from its immediate material contexts constituted a major
milestone in the history of writing and textuality.

In this chapter, I would like to give a historical account of a letter's
passage from paper to pixel. The movement proceeds in three stages, as
illustrated by three specific devices: first the mechanization of type reached
its apogee in the telegraph at the end of the nineteenth century. With the
advent of telegraphy, "content" meant for humans began to intertwine with
"control codes" used to operate machines remotely. Second, where the ticker
tape and the punch card were still legible without specialized "reader"
devices, the invention of magnetic tape submerged the mixed stream of letters
and control codes into an inscrutable substance. Finally, by the mid-twentieth
century, the screen emerged to simulate a measure of legibility lost in the
transition.

Where does computed text reside? I offer the following three historical
preconditions for digital textuality. They are not meant as history, but rather
as signposts to mark the journey ahead. The schema proceeds roughly as follows:
first, content and control couple at the visible surface of removable storage
media (ticker tape and punch card); second, inscription splits into input and
output, retreating into magnetic storage; to reemerge at third and last on the
screen in the same guise, but also, as we suspect, somehow transformed: less
solid and concealing something beneath the phantasmal shell of its former
appearance.

As we embark to explore the consequences of computed text, I propose we keep
the following three landmark mechanisms in view as milestones along our
journey: Goldberg's *Controller*, the IBM *MT/SC*, and Engelbart's *Time Fob*.
In the first of these, text structure and machine control lie before us for
inspection. The second one is mute: a black slate. The last of these belongs to
what Peter Denning calls the "third generation" of computer systems---an
assemblage of storage, input, and output technologies that continue to shape
the contemporary human encounter with text today.[^ln1-denning] These devices
tell the story of a fracture.  Through them, a part of the sign fades from view
into an arrangement of magnetic charge and floating gate at the site of the
archive. Another part appears at the site of projection in the flicker of the
cathode ray and the flow of the liquid crystal.

## A. Teletype (Input)

First, a few words about telegraphy in general. The turn of the twentieth
century was a pivotal period in the history of computing and communications.
The advent of programmable media---punch cards and ticker tape---coupled
natural language alphabets with machine control code.[^ln1-loom] Reduced to
discrete and reliably reproducible alphabets, the so called "natural languages"
could now be converted into the modulation of electrical signal. Language in
such a transitive state became more mobile than ever before. It could be
transmitted efficiently across vast distances. Moreover, the mechanization of
type introduced new "control" characters into circulation, intended to affect
machine state changes at a distance. Initially, such state changes were simple:
"begin transmission," "sound error bell," "start new line." With time, these
control codes developed into what we now know as a programming language. At the
turn of the century, the language of people and the language of machines
entered into the same stream of communications.

As telegraphy spanned national boundaries, agreements were needed to
standardize conventions for equipment and message encoding
[@international_telegraph_union_journal_1899, 82-91]. Such agreements were
handled on a regional, ad-hoc basis until 1865, with the creation of the
International Telegraph Union (ITU). The International Telegraph Conference in
Paris, held between March 1 and May 17 of 1865, adopted, among other things,
the use of a modified Morse code character set, containing 33 Latin letters
(including characters from the French, German, and Spanish alphabets), 10
numbers (0--9), 14 punctuation marks (including a fraction bar), and 10 control
codes (including "end of service," "attention," and "error")
[@international_telegraph_union_documents_1865]. In specifying the conversion
tables for the Morse alphabet, the 1865 ITU rules required a silence equal to
three dots (same as one dash) to indicate the space between two letters, and a
silence equivalent to four dots (later changed to seven) to indicate the space
between words.

Although Morse code can be expressed in terms of ones and zeros (binary), it is
technically a ternary code making use of at least three elements: dots, dashes,
and silences of various length. Furthermore, note that in Morse code a single
letter could be expressed as a series of dots and dashes of variable length:
from one dash that stands for letter "t" to six dots that stand for the number
six. The transmission of variable length codes required the presence of a human
operator who could "translate" form natrual language to the machine alphabet,
using a "key" which when depressed vertically would complete an electrical
curcuit to produce the signal. Writing in 1929 for the journal *American
Speech*, Hervey Brackbill preserved some of the specialized language associated
with Morse code culture. "Morse telegraphy is commonly referred to as a 'game,'
and the operator 'works a wire,'" he wrote. An operator tapping a key "uses a
bug." "The first instruments," Brackbill wrote, "with their long slender levers
and springs, looked very much like a sprawling bug." They have trade names like
"Lighting Bug," "Gold Bug," and "Cootie" (for a small model)
[@brackbill_telegraphers_1929, 287-288]. Operators using "straight keys"
practically achieved speeds upwards of 25--30 words per minute, limited by the
shortest possible length of the smallest transmitted unit (a dot), fixed by the
American and the International Morse Code conventions to 1/24 of a second in
duration.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, companies like Western Electric,
Mecograph, and Vibroplex began manufacturing semi-automatic keys, which made
use of a horizontal switch capable of emitting a rapid succession of dots to
one side of the action, and dashes to the other [@martin_telegraphic_1904;
@boyd_telegraph-key_1916]. A bug was said to "run away" when adjusted for too
high of a speed. The Vibroplex keys would significantly alter the "fist," or
the transmission style of the operator, allowing for speeds that approached 50
words per minute (and above, if not following the minimum signal length
specifications) [@mcnicol_american_1913, 207;
@u.s._bureau_of_labor_statistics_displacement_1932; @halstead_genesis_1949].
Despite the improvements, Morse code was showing its age. Although the
convention stipulated fixed length, the actual length of the silence between
the meaning-carrying units of Morse code could vary greatly with the vagrancies
of the transmitting medium. Cross talk between wires and weather interferences
were common, which meant that communicating in Morse still required a human
operator for efficient ciphering and deciphering of the transmisison. In a
long-chain of mediation telegraph operator, code, and machine, the human posed
a limiting factor.

Telegraph operators working a "hand sender" commonly developed partial
paralysis of wrist or arm, commonly known as a "glass arm"
[@brackbill_telegraphers_1929;
@u.s._bureau_of_labor_statistics_displacement_1932]. A sender was called a
"ham" or a "bum" when he "fell down" or made errors in sending. To "put someone
under the table" in sender's lingo was to transmit faster that the receiver
ability to transcribe. The "reader" was "burnt up" when he fell behind. He had
to "break," or interrupt the sender to ask for repetition. To "paste" someone
meant to transmit at high speeds to deliberately burn him up or put him under
the table [@brackbill_telegraphers_1929].

The International Telegraph Conference in Lisbon, held in the summer of 1908,
ratified two additional alphabet standards for international use: Hughes and
Baudot. Both developed in response to the limitations of Morse, allowing for
fully autonomous telegraph operation.

![Table of Alphabets, 1901 [@vansize_new_1901, 23].](images/alphabets-vansize.png)

This new generation of printing telegraphs could be "programmed" using
removable storage media, in a way that a player piano is "programmed" to play a
piece by means of a music roll. The printing telegraph decoupled the act of
writing and reading from the act of transmission, similar to the way the
perforated music roll decouples the act of playing the piano from the
performance. Using external storage media like ticker tape and punch cards, a
message could be prepared in advance and "fed" into the mechanism for
transmission at rates far exceeded the possibilities of hand-operated Morse
telegraphy. Unlike the Morse alphabet which varied in length, the Baudot in
particular fixed the length of the encoding to five spaces or "bits." Five
"off" and "on" spaces allowed for 2^5=32 permutations. After encoding the
common Latin characters, the schema left space for several special "control"
characters. The "character space" could further be expanded by switching the
receiving mechanism into a special "control mode" in which every combination of
five bits represented an individual control character (instead of a letter).

The invention of fixed-length ciphers lies in the sixth book of Francis Bacon's
*De augmentis scientiarum* (*Division of the Sciences*),[^ln1-bacon] an
encyclopedic treatise on the "partition of sciences" written in the form of a
letter to King James in 1623. Book Six of Bacon's systematic account of the
sciences is dedicated to speech, speaking, writing, grammar (literary and
philosophical), poetry (meter and verse), and, most relevant to our discussion,
"the knowledge of ciphers." Here Bacon boasts of inventing a "highest degree of
cipher" that can signify "all in all" (*omnia per omnia*). Bacon proceeded to
describe a "fivefold," "bi-literarie" alphabet, which encodes each letter of
the English language using a five-letter long string of As and Bs. The letter
A, for example, became "aaaaa." B became "aaaab," C "aaaba," and so on to Z,
rendered as "babbb." "Neither is this a small matter," Bacon wrote:

> These Cypher-Characters have, and may performe: For by this *Art* a way is
opened, whereby a man may expresse and signifie the intentions of his minde, at
any distance of place, by objects which may be presented to the eye, an
accommodated to the eare: provided those objects be capable of a twofold
difference only; as by Bells, by Trumpets, by Lights and Torches, by the
report of Muskets, an any instruments of like nature [@bacon_advancement_1987,
266].

Writing near two centuries after the advent of the Gutenberg press, Bacon
perceived the essence of telegraphy: to express and to signify the intentions
of the human mind at a distance. The Morse and the Baudot codes paved the way
for the automation of human language. The great proliferation of scripts and
alphabets was finally reduced to thirty-two discrete and reproducible
characters. So regularized, type could be converted into electrical signal,
sent over great distances, and used to program machines remotely. The price for
these new affordances given to language was legibility. The translation between
human alphabet and machine transmittable code required first a cadre of
specially trained machine operators, and then specialized equipment which
automated the process of translation itself.

As Bacon's early writings on the language arts suggest, the roots of telegraphy
lie in cypher-making and cryptography. For this reason, the encoding of human
languages for machine use was always intimately connected to war-time,
diplomatic, and otherwise secret communications. The seemingly innocuous
problem of machine translation was therefore from the beginning intertwined
with the question of access and legibility: who gets to understand the encoded
message and when? For example, the Final Protocol to the Telegraph Regulations,
ratified in Madrid in 1932 by the governments of more than seventy countries
including Germany, Brazil, Cuba, Egypt, Empire d'Ethiopie, France, Japan, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain, United States of America, and Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, included a special provision delineating the difference
between transmitting "plain," and "secret" language. The protocols further
grouped "secret languages" into "code" and "cypher" categories. According to
the language of the protocol, "plain language" was that "which presents an
intelligible meaning in one or more of the languages authorized for
international telegraph correspondence, each word and each expression having
the meaning normally assigned to it in the language to which it belongs"
[@itu_telegraph_1932, 12]. By contrast, the regulations specified "code
language" as text "composed either of artificial words, or of real words not
used in the meaning normally assigned to them in the language to which they
belong and consequently not forming intelligible phrases" [@itu_telegraph_1932,
12]. Codes were not permitted to contain more than five characters and were
   charged at 6/10th of the agreed tariff rate. Upon request, the sender of the
telegram in code language was required to "produce the code from which the text
or part of the text of the telegram has been compiled" [@itu_telegraph_1932,
13]. Otherwise, the language was considered to be a secret "cypher," defined as
   "groups or series of Arabic figures with a secret meaning."

According to the terms of the convention, all administrations agree to accept
and to pass telegrams in plain language through their jurisdiction. The
undesigned agreed also to allow secret communication to pass in transit through
their territory, although they were allowed also to refuse to admit them "both in
acceptance and in delivery" [@itu_telegraph_1932, 13].

A number of American patents at the dusk of Morse age attempted to address the
challenge of illegibility of machine code. Code obscured intended meaning,
which in international communication had implications for national security.
But code also presented a barrier to human understanding. It was was difficult
to encode and to decode without special training. "You must acknowledge that
this is readable without special training," reads the caption to a schematic
illustration for a "controller," patented by H.E. Goldberg in 1911. "My
invention relates to all controllers," Goldberg writes. The object of
Goldberg's controller was "to provide a mechanism operable by a control sheet
which is legible to every person having sufficient education to enable him to
read." Goldberg illustrates his invention in attaching to his patent "a control
sheet in which the control characters are in the form of the letters of the
ordinary English alphabet" [@goldberg_controller_1915]. Rather than using
ticker tape, Goldberg proposed the use of perforations that while capable of
actuating machine levers also formed letters. To counteract the
unintelligibility of code, Goldberg imagines using cards, perforated in the
shape of the English alphabet. Thus besides carrying human-readable content,
Goldberg's cards did "double duty" to mechanically manipulate the machine's
"blocks," "handles," "terminal blades," and "plungers"
[@goldberg_controller_1915].  On Goldberg's control sheets, the language of
machines and the language of humans coincided at one and the same plane.

![Goldberg's Control Cards [@goldberg_controller_1915].](images/control-2.png)

By the late 1920s the "Morse men" were being replaced with more efficient
automated devices. By the 1930s, devices variously known as "printer
telegraphs," "teletypewriters," and "teletypes" displaced Morse code telegraphy
as the dominant mode of commercial communication. The monthly "Labor Review"
report published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in March of 1932
estimates more than a 50 percent drop in the number of Morse code operators
between the years of 1915 and 1931. Morse operators referred to the
tele-typists on the sending side as "punchers" and on the receiving side as
"printer men."[^ln1-printermen] The printer men responsible for assembling
pages from ticker tape were called "pasters" and sometimes, derisively, as
"paperhangers" [@brackbill_telegraphers_1929]. Where Morse code telegraphy
required the mediation of a human-operator responsible for translating language
into code, teletype automated the process entirely. The operator could simply
enter printed characters into the machine directly, using a keyboard similar to
the typewriter, by that time widely in business use. The teletype would then
automatically transcode the input into transmitted signal and then back from
the signal onto paper on the receiving end. Operators did not need to concern
themselves with machine code at all. They saw only the familiar alphabet
letters.

With the advent of the automated telegraph, content meant for people was now
routinely being intermixed with code meant to control machine devices remotely.
Such remote control capabilities were used for everything from programming
radio stations to advertising billboards and knitting machines
[@hough_wired_1931; @adler_knitting_1933; @casper_remote_1934]. Early
paper-based storage media, from Morse code-based ticker tape systems, to the
telegraphs of Hughes and Baudot, and to punch cards that powered weaving looms,
player pianos, and census tabulators coupled natural language with machine
control. The concern with the legibility of machine code emerges during the
first few decades of the twentieth century. For the first time in the history
of writing, the alphanumerical sign splits between human- and machine- readable
inscription. For a time, the inscription remains visible at the surface of the
control sheet, as perforated figure, punched through the medium. 

The era of ticker tape punch cards can be thought to end with the mass-market
introduction of IBM's Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typewriter in 1964. Magnetic
storage media further submerges the inscription beneath an inscrutable facade.

[^ln1-printermen]: According to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics, women
comprised 24 percent of Morse operators in 1915 (before the wide-spread advent
of automated telegraphy). By 1931 women comprised 64 percent of printer and
Morse manual operators [@u.s._bureau_of_labor_statistics_displacement_1932,
514].

## B. Magnetic tape (Storage)

"Historically unforeseen, barely a thing, software's ghostly presence produces
and defies apprehension," Wendy Chun wrote in her *Programmed Visions*, an
influential monograph that continues to shape the field of software studies.
She quotes several prominent computer scientists and media historians to the
same effect. But what gives software its ephemeral quality? 

Embossed onto ticker tape or punched into the card, early software protruded
through the medium. In the age of the telegraph, the biggest barrier to the
comprehension of software was encoding. Morse code and similar alphabet
conventions left a visible mark on the paper. Once the machine alphabet
identified, it could be translated back into natural language using a simple
lookup table. The ticker tape gave the means to translate human language into
an electronic signal. Once mechanized the signal could be used to communicate
and to control machines remotely. But we would hardly call early programmable
media ephemeral or immaterial. Anecdotes circulate in the digital humanities
circles about Father Roberto Busa, the early pioneer in the field of
computational philology, who in the 1960s carted his punch cards around Italy
on a truck.[^ln2-busa] Code before its electromagnetic period was fragile and
unwieldy. Just like writing with pen and paper, making an error on ticker tape
entry required cumbersome corrections and sometimes wholesale re-entry of lines
or pages. On the surface of ticker tape, the inscription still made a strong
commitment to the medium. Once committed to paper it was near-immutable. 

Magnetic tape changed the nature of the commitment between inscription and
medium. It gave a temporary home to the word, where the word could be changed
and manipulated before committing to paper. A typist using the new generation
of magnetically-enabled devices could manipulate words "in memory," on a medium
that could be easily erased and rewritten. The magnetic charge adheres lightly
to the tape surface. The "light touch" of the magnetic inscription gave the
word its ephemeral quality. But it was also light enough as to be nearly
imperceptible. In applications like law and banking, where the fidelity between
input, storage, and output were absolutely crucial, the illegible property of
magnetic storage posed a significant engineering challenge. In this section, I
would like to describe a few devices that attempted to address the problem of
illegibility. After the advent of teletype, but before the screen, the creators
of these machines used a variety of strategies to restore a measure of
congruence between visible paper inscription and the invisible magnetic
representation. Legibility, as these devices show, was one of the problems
driving innovation.

The principles of magnetic recording were developed by Oberlin Smith (among
others), the American engineer who also filed several inventions related to
weaving looms at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1888, inspired by
Edison's mechanical phonograph, Smith made public his experiments with an
"electrical method" of sound recording using a "magnetized cord" (cotton mixed
with hardened steel dust) as a recording medium. These experiments were later
put into practice by Valdemar Poulsen of Denmark, who patented several
influential designs for a magnetic wire recorder [@smith_possible_1888;
@poulsen_method_1900; @engel_1888-1988_1988; @thiele_magnetic_1988;
@daniel_magnetic_1998; @vasic_coding_2004].

Magnetic recording on wire or plastic tape offered several advantages over
mechanical perforation. Tape was more durable than paper; it could fit more
information per square inch; and, most importantly, it was reusable. "One of
the important advantages of magnetic recording is that the record may be erased
if desired, and a new record made in its place," Marvin Camras, a physicist
with the Armour Research Foundation, wrote in 1948 [@camras, 505]. At the turn
of the century, most of the developments in magnetic storage were aimed at
sound recording. The use of magnetic medium for the storage of data did not
take off in earnest until the 1950s [@dee, 1775]. Yet some of the early
developers of electro-magnetic storage and recording technology already
conceived of their work as having an impact on knowledge production broadly and
on the history of the book in particular. Addressing the Franklin Institute on
December 16th of 1908 Charles Fankhauser, the inventor of the electromagnetic
"telegraphone," said the following:

> To transport human speech over a distance of one thousand miles is a
> wonderful achievement. How much more wonderful, then, is the achievement that
> makes possible [...] its storage at the receiving end, so that the exact
> sentence, the exact intonation of the voice, the exact timbre may be
> reproduced over and over again, an endless number of times"
[@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 39]

Comparing magnetic recording to the invention of the Gutenberg press,
Fankhauser went on to say:

> It is my belief that what type has been to the spoken word, the telegraphone
> will be to the electrically transmitted word [...] As printing spread
> learning and civilization among the peoples of the earth and influenced
> knowledge and intercourse among men, so I believe the telegraphone will
> influence and spread electrical communication among men"
[@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 40].

In that speech, Fankhauser laments what he calls the "evanescence" of telegraph
and telephone communications. The telephone fails to preserve "an authentic
record of the conversion over the wire" [@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 40].
Fankhauser imagines his telegraphone in use by "the sick, the infirm, and the
aged:"

> A book can be read to the sightless or the invalid by the machine, while the
patient lies in bed. Lectures, concerts, recitations---what one wishes, may be
had at will. Skilled readers or expert elocution teachers could be employed to
read into the wires entire libraries [@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 44].

Anticipating the popularity of twenty-first century audio media formats like
the podcast and the audio book, Fankhauser imagines "tired and jaded" workers
who "sooth themselves into a state of restfulness" by listening to their
favorite authors. Poulsen's "electric writing" will finally emerge "as clear
and as distinct as the writing by hand, an absolutely legal and conclusive
record," Fankhauser concluded [@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 41].

In the first decade of the twentieth century, Fankhauser imagined magnetic
storage as an audio format, combining the best of telegraphy and telephony in
once device. For the purposes of data storage, magnetic recording technology
did not mature until the 1950s, when advances in composite plastics made it
possible to manufacture tape cheaper and more durable than its paper
alternatives. The state of the art relay calculator commissioned by the Bureau
of Ordinance of the Navy Department in 1944 and built by the Harvard
Computation laboratory in 1947 still made use of standard issue telegraph "tape
readers and punchers," adapted for computation with the aid of engineers from
Western Union Telegraph Company [@staff_description_1949, 1-40].[^ln2-punch]
The relay calculator was equipped with a number of Teletype Model 12A tape
readers and Model 10B perforators, using 11/16-inch wide paper tape,
partitioned into "five intelligence holes." To give you a sense of the
machine's storage capacity, each quantity entered for computation took up
thirteen lines of code [@staff_description_1949, 30]. The readers and punches
were capable of running at 600 operations per minute. Four Model 15
Page-Printers gave the means to compare the printed characters with the digits
stored in the ticker tape-based controlling print register. In this setup, the
numerical inscription was therefore already split between input and output
channels: with input stored on ticker tape and output on the printed page for
verification.

The Mark III Calculator which followed the Harvard Computation Laboratory's
earlier efforts was likewise commissioned by the Navy's Bureau of Ordinance. It
was completed in 1950. The Mark III "organization" (we would say "architecture"
today) jettisoned tape in favor of multiple magnetic drums and a system of
reel-to-reel tape recorders. The drums, limited in their storage capacity,
revolved at much faster speeds than tape. They were used for fast, temporary,
internal storage.  The surface of the magnetic drums was coated with a "thin
film composed of finely divided magnetic oxides of iron suspended in a plastic
lacquer, and applied to the drums with an artist's air brush"
[@staff_description_1952, 1]. Mark III employed twenty-five such drums,
rotating at 6900 rpm and each capable of storing 240 binary digits. 

In addition to the fast "internal storage" drums, the "floor plan" included
eight slow "external storage" tape-read mechanisms. Tape was slower than drums
but cheaper and easily extensible to multiple reels, answering the ideals of
the Turing device, which called for "infinite tape." In practice, the tape was
not infinite, but merely long enough to answer the needs of military
computation. Unlike the drums, the tape was easily removable. Operators could
prepare tape in advance at the alloted Instructional Tape Preparation Table.
The information on tape would then be transferred to a slow moving drum and
transferred again to the fast-moving internal drum for data calculation,
machine sequencing, and control. Mark III was further equipped with five
printers "for presenting computed results in a form suitable for publication."
The printers were capable of determining the "number of digits to be printed,
the intercolumnar and interlinear spacing, and other items related to the
typography of the printed page" [@staff_description_1952, 1-40].

Data was recorded on tape using binary numerical notation. To enter the number
onto tape, the operator sat at the "numerical tape preparation table," another
piece of furniture separate from the main machine. The data was stored on tape
along two channels, running the length of the tape. The operator entered each
number twice, first into Channel A and then into Channel B. This was done to
prevent errors, since the operator worked blindly, without being able to see
whether the intended mark registered properly upon first entry. An error bell
would sound when the first quantity did not match the second, in which case the
operator would have to reenter the mismatched digits [@staff_description_1952,
143-88]. To further "ensure completely reliable results" the operator could use
one of the five attached Underwood Electric teletypes to print all of the
tape's columns and confirm visually.

I cover significant technical detail throughout to make sure that the
contemporary reader understands what I describe as the "splitting of the sign"
or the "multiple locations of the inscription" not as a metaphor, but
literally. Where the typewriter or the whole punch transfered the inscription
from keyboard to paper directly, at the stroke of hammer and key, early
electromagnetic devices compounded the inscription across multiple surfaces.
The movement of the computed sign necessitated manifold "phase transitions"
between media: from one channel of the tape to another, from tape to drum, from
a slow drum to a fast one, and from drum and tape to paper. Where before, on
ticker tape, the inscription remained visible, at least before it entered the
wires as electrical signal, it now disappeared from view soon after the key
press. Submerged into magnetic surface it began to resist direct observation.
The computed sign underwent a number of transformations in the process of
displacement in time and in space. You could prepare tape today, compute it
tomorrow, and transmit it the day after. The transformation of the inscription
from one medium to another, from one format into another in effect constitute
what we mean by the "processing" part of "word processing." Telegraphy forever
intertwined the symbol with machine control. Magnetic storage made it
invisible.

The potential incongruence between invisible data storage and its apparent
representation was a key problem in the decades preceding the advent of the
screen simulation. In a patent filed in 1954 on the behalf of the Borroughs
Corporation of Detroit, Michigan Herman Epstein and Frank Innes describe an
"electrographic printer," involving an "electrical method and apparatus for
making electrostatic images on a dielectric surface by electrical means which
may be rendered permanently visible" [@epstein_electrographic_1961, 1]. The
electrographic printer anticipated the modern photocopier. Rather than storing
data in code, the inventors imagined forming letter shapes directly on the
surface of magnetic tape, in a kind of a magnetic figure. A small printing head
would convert binary input into a five-by-seven grid of charges, capable of
rendering the English alphabet. The magnetic image could then be combined with
a recording medium having the "correct physical properties to adhere to the
electrostatic latent images" [@epstein_electrographic_1961, 2]. A light dusting
of powder ink would reveal the hidden magnetic image.

!["Images formed by a negative voltage," from Electrographic Printer by Epstein
and Innes [@epstein_electrographic_1961]](images/magnetic-alphabet-epstein.png)

Advances in magnetic storage in the field of audio recording and in
supercomputer applications like the Mark III found their way into the business
and home offices a decade later, in the 1960s. In 1964, IBM combined magnetic
tape storage with its *Selectric* line of electric typewriters, introducing the
Magnetic Tape Selectric (MT/ST) line of typewriters to the mass market. Writing
for the *Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science* in 1992, Daniel
Eisenberg mentions the MT/ST as one of the first word processors, defined by
the ability to record strokes and to print them onto paper *as a separate
operation* [@eisenberg_word_1992]. Built on a simpler architecture than its
supercomputer cousins, the MT/ST used a single tape read and write mechanism.
An advertisement in the American Bar Association circa 1968 calls it the
$10,000 typewriter that is "worth every penny." Before, the typist would have
to stop and erase every mistake, the copy reads. But with IBM MT/ST it is
possible to to "backspace, retype, and keep going." The mistake is changed on
magnetic tape, "where all typing is recorded and played back correctly at
incredible speed" [@association_aba_1976, 998]. But just as it was with Mark
III, the data stored on the magnetic tape was absolutely invisible to the
typist. At the time, the only way to verify the magnetic inscription was to
print it out.

What was gained in the freeing of text from the confines of immutable media
like ink and paper, was gotten at the price of legibility.  Encoding used by
the IBM MT/ST typewriter retained the familiar underlying structure of a 7-bit
encoding scheme, not dissimilar from Bacon's secret writing. But on tape, the
encoding scheme ceased to be recoverable by the naked eye. The inscription lay
literally beyond human sense. On tape, "magnetic domains" and "polarities" took
place of visible, albeit encoded, alphabets.[^ln2-magnet] The developers of
these early systems recognized the problem of congruence between the visible
and the invisible sign. The machine operator needed to ensure that the input
correspond to the stored quantity. But the only way to check the stored
quantity was to once again transform it into another inscription. Direct access
to the site of storage was near-impossible.

The engineers working on Mark III attempted to address the problem of
congruence by asking the operator to input quantities twice. Other solutions
included making the magnetic mark more apparent. For example, the "magnetic
reader" patented by Robert Youngquist and Robert Hanes in 1962 promised a
"device for visual observation of magnetic symbols recorded on a magnetic
recording medium in tape or sheet form." Youngquist and Hanes wrote:

> Magnetic recording tape is often criticized because the recorded signals are
invisible, and the criticism has been strong enough to deny it certain
important markets. For example, this has been a major factor in hampering sales
efforts at substituting magnetic recording tape and card equipment for punched
tape and card equipment which presently is dominant in automatic digital
data--handling systems. Although magnetic recording devices are faster and more
troublefree, potential customers have often balked at losing the ability to
check recorded information visually. It has been suggested that the information
be printed in ink alongside the magnetic signals, but this vitiates major
competitive advantages of magnetic recording sheet material, e.g., ease in
correction, economy in reuse, simplicity of equipment, compactness of recorded
data, etc." [@youngquist_magnetic_1961, 1].

The magnetic reader comprised a flat box that resembles a book. Youngquist and
Hanes proposed to fill the cover plate of their box with a transparent liquid
to host "visible, weakly ferromagnetic crystals." When sandwiched between the
two plates, a piece of magnetic tape would activate the crystals to align with
the embedded inscription. In this way, the top plate would reveal the "visible
outlines" of the underlying magnetic symbol [@youngquist_magnetic_1961, 1].

!["The positioning of a magnetic recording card for visual observation of
symbols recorded thereon," from [@youngquist_magnetic_1961, 1]](youngquist.png)

Yet the problem remained. Data arrangement along the length of the magnetic
tape was fundamentally different from data arranged on paper. The next
generation of IBM Magnetic Selectric typewriters added a "composer" control
unit to further manipulate storage data for meaningful output. The original IBM
Composer unit achieved margin justification (its chief innovation over the
typewriter) by asking the operator to type each line twice: "one rough typing
to determine what a line would contain, and a second justified typing"
[@morgan_ibm_1968, 69]. After the "first typing," an indicator mechanism helped
the operator calculate the variable spacing needed to achieve paragraph
justification. The formatting and content of each line thus required separate
passes to achieve the desired result. IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer
(MT/SC) combined the typing capabilities of the Selectric line of typewriters,
with the Magnetic Tape storage unit of the MT/ST unit, with the formatting
capabilities of the Composer. Rather than having the operator type each line
twice, the MT/SC system printed the entered text twice: once on the "input
station printout" which showed both the content and the control codes, printed
in red ink, and the second time as the final "Composer output" printout, which
presented the final typeset copy. The output operator would still have to
intervene manually, however, to make decisions about paper loading, type font
changes, and hyphenation decisions.  What was once a monolithic unit on the
page was thereby systematically separated into several distinct layers in the
process of composition. 

Like other devices of this generation, the IBM MT/SC suffered from the problem
of invisible storage. Error checking on paper via multiple printouts was aided
by a control panel consisting of "11 display lights." The configuration of
lights could be used to "peek" at the underlying data storage during otherwise
blind entry. In an attempt to achieve greater congruence between visible data
and data archived on the magnetic medium, IBM briefly explored the idea of
using magnetic cards instead of tape. Where on tape, information had to be
stored serially, as one long column of codes, on a magnetic card the spatial
relation between elements could be preserved. The 1968 patent for "Data
Reading, Recording, and Positioning System" describes a method for arranging
information on such a card "recording and playback system which accurately
positions each character recorded relative to each previous character recorded
[@clancy_data_1970, 1]. In in 1969 IBM further refined the Selectric Composer
line to make use of magnetic cards instead of magnetic tape. Later, in 1981,
reflecting on the evolution of word processing in the 1960s Frederick May
whose name appears on several of IBM's patents from the period wrote: 

> A major reason for the choice of a magnetic card for the recording of medium
> was the simple relationship that could be maintained between a typed page and
> a recorded card.  In effect this relationship made the magnetic card a unit
> of record of storage of a typed page [@may_ibm_1981, 743].

![IBM Mag Card II, introduced in 1969 for use in the Magnetic Card/Selectric
Typewriter (MC/ST) in 1969. "A simple relationship could be maintained between
a typed page and a recorded card" [@may_ibm_1981, 744].  Image by Pointillist

1.2.](images/ibm-card.png)

Despite these improvements, the card remained an opaque slate. Speaking at the
1967 symposium on electronic composition in printing, Jon Haley, staff director
of the Congressional Joint Committee on printing, put it this way: "compromises
with legibility [...] had been made for the sake of pure speed in composition
and dissemination of the end product [@technology_electronic_1968, 48]. The
automation of type made the word faster. The magnetic storage made it lighter
and more compact. It allowed for processing before commitment. But these gains
were made at the cost of visibility. The consequences of that bargain will
become apparent later.
 
[^ln2-busa]: See for example @hockey_history_2004, "Father Busa has stories of
truckloads of punched cards being transported from one center to another in
Italy."

[^ln2-punch]: "Two means are available for preparing the functional tapes
required for the operation of the interpolators. First, when the tabular values
of *f(x)* have been previously published, they may be copied on the keys of the
functional tape preparation unit [...] and the tape produced by the punches
associated with this unit, under manual control. Second, as suitable control
tape may be coded directing the calculator to compute the values of *f(x)* and
record them by means of one of the four output punches, mounted on the right
wing of the machine" [@staff_description_1949, 34].

## C. Screen, (Output)

By decoupling input and output, magnetic storage and solid state media afford
the injection of time and space, in arbitrary intervals, between the process of
inscription and comprehension. Content, coupled with control code, sinks
beneath the matte surface of electrical charge. The final movement in the
emergence of automated discourse reintroduces the illusion of immediacy into
the process of inscription. Text, invisible in its material substratum,
reappears on the screen, but, crucially, it no longer corresponds to its mirror
inscription. This property is as perilous as it is liberating: perilous,
because the flows of power and control can now be submerged under the
shimmering surface of the screen, and liberating, because loosely coupled to
their material substratum texts become both more fluid and more portable.
Plainly put, the systematic barriers to copying, sharing, exchanging, editing,
remixing, and disseminating texts are reduced to a minimum.

Ersatz skeuomorphism (between disk storage and screen image) leads to the
reception of digital text as an ephemeral artifact. With the illusory role of
the screen in mind, I propose 1968 as the year in which the contemporary
textual condition takes its present form. On December 9, 1968 Douglas
Engelbart, then founder and primary investigator at the NASA- and ARPA-funded
Augmentation Research Center lab at the Stanford Research Institute, gave what
later became known colloquially as "the mother of all demos
[@tweney_mother_2008]" before an audience of roughly one thousand or so
computer professionals attending the Fall Joint Computer Conference held at the
Convention Center in San Francisco [@rogers_demo_2005]. The demo announced the
arrival of almost every technology prophesied by Vannevar Bush in his
influential 1945 piece for *The Atlantic* [@bush_as_1945]. Speaking a little
over an hour,  through a headset, in a prerecorded address, Engelbart features
functional (live) prototypes of the following: graphical user interfaces, video
conferencing, remote camera monitoring, links and hypertext, version control,
text search, image manipulation, windows-based user interfaces, digital slides,
networked machines, mouse, stylus, and joystick inputs, and "what you see is
what you get" (WYSIWYG) word processing.

!["NOW IS THE TIME FOB." Schematics for a "display system" [@engelbart_x-y_1970].](images/engel.png)

In his report to NASA, which sponsored research on "intellect augmentation"
along with DARPA, Engelbart describes his lab as a group of scientists
"developing an experimental laboratory around an interactive, multiconsole
computer-display system" and "working to learn the principles by which
interactive computer aids can augment the intellectual capability of the
subjects" [@engelbart_human_1969, 1]. Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays were
central to this research mission. In one of many patents that came out of
"intellect augmentation" laboratory, Engelbart pictures the "display system" as
a workstation that combines a typewriter, a CRT, and a mouse. The system is
frozen in mid-action, with the words "THE TIME IS NOW FOB" prominently
displayed on the screen. Although Engelbart does not explain the message, the
system's user is evidently in the process of editing a sentence and about to
correct the nonsensical FOB into a FOR. Engelbart writes, "One of the
potentially most promising means for delivering and receiving information to
and from digital computers involves the display of computer outputs as visual
representation on a cathode ray tube and the alternation of the display by
human operator in order to deliver instructions to the computer"
[@engelbart_x-y_1970].

The CRT closes the circuit between human and machine, with a few caveats. In
practice, the short-lived screen-less word processors (like the IBM MT/ST)
necessitated for the cognitively arduous task of continuously keeping the
underlying document structure in the mind's eye. The CRT lifts that burden by
unfolding the structure topographically, allowing for spatial navigation along
the document---restoring, in a sense, the natural affordances of print. Data
becomes visible again. Moreover, represented in the shimmer of the cathode ray,
it attaches itself lightly to the retina. Users trying out this way of writing
for the first time report that the screen liberates them from the material
confines of print textuality. One user, possibly Engelbart himself, writes the
following:[^ln2-follow]

[^ln2-follow]: I reproduce the text verbatim and preserving the line breaks,
since formatting is an important part of the reported experience.

```
    1B2B1 "To accommodate and preserve a thought or
    piece of information that isn't related to the work
    of the moment, one can very quickly and easily
    insert a note within the structure of a file at such
    a place that it will nether get in the way nor get
    lost.

    1B2B2 "Later, working in another part of the file,
    he can almost instantly (e.g. within two seconds)
    return to the place where he temporarily is storing
    such notes, to modify or add to any of them.

    1B2B3 "As any such miscellaneous thought develops,
    it is easy (and delightful) to reshape the structure
    and content of its discussion material.
```

Engelbart, interested in collecting empirical phenomenological accounts of the
system, records what must count as several of the most evocative passages to
appear on the pages of a NASA technical report. In the "Results and Discussion"
section an anonymous user continues to report:

```
1B4 "I find that I can express myself better, if I can
make all the little changes and experiments with wording
and structure as they occur to me." [Here the user
experiments a little with using structural decomposition
of a complex sentence.]
```

A deconstruction indeed follows, as the author begins to deviate from the
conventions of the technical report. The numbered passages, and unexpected
enjambment, heightens the staccato quality of the prose, which at times reaches
towards the lyric:


```
    1B4A "I find that I write faster and more freely,

        1B4A1 "pouring thoughts and trial words on the
        screen with much less inhibition,

        1B4A2 "finding it easy to repair mistakes or wrong
        choices

            1B4A22 "so while capturing a thought I don't
            have to inhibit the outpouring of thought and
            action to do it with particular correctness,

        1B4A3 "finding that several trials at the right
        wording can be done very quickly

            1B4A3A "so I can experiment, easily take a look
            and see how a new version strikes me--and often
            the first unworried attempt at a way to express
            something turn out to be satisfactory, or at
            least to require only minor touch up.

        1B4A4 "Finding that where I might otherwise
        hesitate in search of the right word, I now pour out
        a succession of potentially appropriate words,
        leaving them all the while the rest of the
        statement takes shape. Then I select from among
        them, or replace them all, or else merely change the
        list a it and wait for a later movement of the
        spirit.
```

When input and output coincide in time, as they do on paper, mistakes can be
costly. The writer must commit to making an inscription and, once made, the
inscription gains permanence in a way that is difficult to correct. One can
erase, removing a layer of physical material, or cover up, adding a layer of
white ink to repair the damage. Engelbart's anonymous writer reports a feeling
of freedom from such commitment to physical medium. He or she can simply
"backspace" and start over. The contemporary reader may take such things for
granted now, but imagine trying to write in that way for the first time.
Writing "comes easy," becomes "uninhibited," and it "pours out" experimentally.
Rather than manipulate language mentally, the writer "pours" the words onto the
screen and then "selects" the right one, without hesitation. The highly
hierarchical and blocky paragraph structure, along with its repetitive refrain,
"finding" and "I find that," gives the prose a hypnotic drive forward, which
matches the reported experience of liberation. Anonymous continues:

```
    1B4B "I find that,

        1B4B1 "being much more aware of

            1B4B1A "the relationships among the phrases of a
            sentence,

            1B4B1B "among the statements of a list,

            1B4B1C "and among the various level and members
            of a branch,

        1B4B2 "being able

            1B4B2A "to view them in different ways,

            1B4B2B "to rearrange them easily,

            1B4B2C "to experiment with certain special
            portrayals,

                1B4B2C1 "not available easily in unstructured data

                1B4B2C2 "or usable without the CRT display,

        1B4B3 "and being aware that

            1B4B3A "I can (and am seeking to) develop still
            further special conventions and computer aids

            1B4B3B "to make even more of this available and
            easy,

        1B4B4 "all tend to increase

            1B4B4A "my interest and experimentation

            1B4B4B "and my conviction that this is but a
            peek at what is to come soon.
```

The passages are too contrived to be spontaneous admissions of phenomenological
experience. Despite the experimental structure, the passages contain a
well-formed rhetorical message advancing key elements of Engelbart's research
program, which aimed to develop new data structures in combination with new
ways of displaying them. Yet I cannot help but be carried away by the fluency
of the prose and by the sheer audacity of the project. Here's someone who has
not only glimpsed the future, but has also brought it into being. The
contemporary author can drag and drop passages around with more facility, but
he has not himself structured his cognitive environment. In Engelbart's terms,
someone else has augmented the author's intellect, in ways that may or may not
fit the individual psyche. That feeling of effortless textuality cannot
therefore be taken at face value, by the unreliable phenomenological accounts
alone. To bring his system into being, Engelbart convened what he called a
"bootstrap community," which through recursive self-improvement could lift
itself up towards a smarter, more efficient, and as the report's lexicon
betrays, a more human way of working. To accomplish this, the group crafted
novel instruments for input and output. They wrote new programming languages,
compilers to interpret them, and debuggers to troubleshoot. They invented word
editors and format control languages. Here's how Engelbart diagrams a *part* of
his text-manipulation language in the same report:

!["State--chart portrayal of part of text--manipulation control language"
[@engelbart_human_1969, 36].](images/engel-edit.png)

The diagram shows much attention to the detail of and love for the writing
craft. But there is also much complexity. It is near impenetrable. In building
their own tools, Engelbart's team lifted themselves up by the bootstraps. But
it was not the machine that lifted them up---it was the process of creating the
machine. The very metaphor of bootstrapping suggests the impossibility of using
one's bootstraps to pull others out of the Platonic cave. As a side effect of
that effort, text, before readily apparent on the page, now enters a complex
system of executable code and control structure. The perception of material
lightness of textual being comes at the price of legibility. Would new authors
find the same ease in the complication of the mechanism? I suspect not unless
they become an active part of a "bootstrapping community" of their own.

[^ln2-brain]: We will later entertain the (real) possibility of
non-representational communication, suggested by early experiments in direct
brain-to-brain or brain-to-machine interfaces.


## Microanalysis

Object of study.

Why am I reading Ltour. Because latour gives us a way to see much lit.

In a study on the construction of scientific knowledge, Bruno Latour and Steve
Woolgar perform what they call an ethnography of a science lab by exposing the
passage of ideas from applied experiment to literary production. For Woolgar
and Latour a laboratory functions as a factory of sorts, ingesting matter and
artifact to produce fact and inscription, beyond simplistic notions of
knowledge-making and discovery [@latour_laboratory_1986]. A cite of production. 

Although much cited in the study of culture, science, and technology,
*Laboratory Life* has had less of an impact on the study of literature, even
though Latour and Woolgar borrowed much the other way around. In the 1986
postscript to the American edition, they remark on the broad trend in literary
theory toward treating texts as objects of interpretation, disavowing the kind
of criticism aimed at the "real meaning of texts," at "what the text says,"
"what really happened," or "what the authors intended"
[@latour_laboratory_1986, 273]. Similarly, the authors wanted to aim research
in the social study of science at the "contingent character of objectification
practices." Science, in their view, is itself a type of literary system,
"generating texts whose fate (status, value, utility, facticity) depends
subsequently on interpretation" [@latour_laboratory_1986, 273]. Throughout the
book, Woolgar and Latour use the term literature to mean something "inscribed,
printed, or published," a combination of verbs that coincides with "literature"
consistently throughout [@latour_laboratory_1986, 47-53]. Viewed as a work of
literary theory, *Laboratory Life* reifies the research program began by the
post-structuralists. Where Jacques Derrida could remark offhandedly that
"everything is a text,"[^ln2-derrida] Woolgar and Latour make concrete the
literal transformation of matter into text. No longer was literature an
illustration of something that happens in the laboratory: Latour and Woolgar
showed the laboratory itself to function as an inscription-making machine.

The conventional way to understand Woolgar and Latour brings the interpreter
into the laboratory, breaking the illusion of scientific objectivity: instead
of "discovering" facts, scientists construct them (therefore, *social
constructivism*). Paradoxically, as Latour and Woolgar worked to undermine the
empirical unity of science (turning it into a kind of hermeneutics), they
performed literary analysis as an empirical method. To "read" the laboratory,
researchers observed the space in person, embedded into the fabric of its
everyday activity. As ethnographers, Woolgar and Latour were interested in
discovering models of objectivity (and science) that emanate from the practice
doing science localized to the particular laboratory under observation. A
theory of knowledge formation therefore becomes visible through ethnographic
description. In the *Laboratory Life* the reader is asked to examines a range
of evidentiary material along with published work. Floor plans, research
samples, workflow diagrams, dialog transcriptions, time sheets, and logbooks
all become a part of the epistemology.

To view Woolgar and Latour as scholars of literature (and not just of
laboratories) is to open up the floodgates of textuality. The laboratory, the
courthouse, the hospital---these institutions cannot be reduced to text, but
the lesson of *Laboratory Life* is that they are, in part, literary systems.
Beneath every scientific discovery, every popular song, every film, radio, or
television serial, every art or architectural project, every political office,
every legal judgment, every restaurant meal, every doctor's prescription, every
website, and every machine manual---beneath that giant and perplexing pile of
human activity lies a complex network of circulating textual documentation.
Woolgar and Latour show that literary scholarship can involve more than just
reading books, but also making visible that textual undercurrent: following it
and mapping its movements across rooms and offices, all the while exposing the
mechanisms of its mutation and locomotion. It is an exciting prospect: to view
the hospital as a library, where cadres of physicians and administrators
convert human stories into diagnoses, into controlled vocabularies, into files,
into billable codes, into inscriptions, and into archives. Or to see the legal
system as a process of literary discovery, where legions of attorneys and
paralegals pore over terabytes of textual material, transforming inscription
into evidence. That is not all these institutions are, but they are also that;
and there is much work to be done there for a scholar of literature.

On an average day in 2008, at home, an average American read around 100,500
words a day. At 250 words per page, that is around 402 printed pages.  Between
the years of 1980 and 2008, the consumption of information in bytes---a measure
that would obviously privilege storage-heavy content like sound and
video---grew at a modest 5.4 percent per year. Reading, in decline until the
advent of the internet, has tripled in the same period. Reading in print
accounted for 26 percent of verbal information consumed in 1960. That number
fell to 9 percent in 2008, but the consumption of words digitally increased to
27 percent of total consumption, which means that reading has increased its
share of the overall household attention span [@bohn_how_2009;
@hilbert_worlds_2011; @hilbert_info_2012]. The first decade of the twenty-first
century saw a 20 percent increase in library visitation
[@u.s._institute_of_museum_and_library_services_public_2010]. According to
UNESCO data, literacy rates continue to rise globally, as the world calibrates
imbalances of access along the lines of gender and geography
[@huebler_adult_2013]. By a conservative estimate, the number of scientific
publications grows at about 4.7 percent per year, which means that the amount
of published research roughly doubles every 15 years or so, and the figures are
much higher in some fields [@archambault_welcome_2005; @crespi_empirical_2008;
@larsen_rate_2010]. The number of books published in the United States almost
tripled from 2005 to 2009 [@bowker_u.s._2009].

All measures point to a drastic expansion of the textual field. At the same
time, we are often told that reading of short stories, novels, poetry, and
plays appears to be at grave risk [stephens_rise_1998; @merrin_television_1999;
@nea_reading_2004; @golumbia_cultural_2009; @fish_digital_2012;
@marche_literature_2012].[^ln2-internet] Something does not add up. As a
society we are reading, writing, and publishing more each year. The
reconciliation of vocabularies locates the source of the perceived metaphysical
threat in the culture's profound alienation from the material contexts of
literary production. The language of literary theory is supremely tuned to deal
with symbols. Only after long reflection, on the order of centuries, do we
begin to note the sheer strangeness of the textual interface: the medieval
palimpsest, the stylus, and the goat parchment. Yet we cannot afford to care
less about the keyboard and the screen today that we do about ink and paper.  A
battle is quietly brewing for the soul of computing and hence for the control
of our basic reading and writing apparatus.

Where literacy thrives, the very nature of what constitutes a literary text (of
any kind) has changed significantly with the advent of ubiquitous computing and
its related techniques involving the internet, integrated circuits, magnetic
storage, miniaturization, and search and suggest algorithms. By many accounts,
the second half of the twentieth century saw a major technological shift
affecting the production, access, and distribution of knowledge, in a shift
comparable in its consequences to those accompanying the spread of the
Gutenberg printing press in the fifteenth century [@johns_piracy:_2009;
@kovarik_revolutions_2011]. Matters always central to the field of literary
studies remain vitally important to the functioning of modern society. Literary
studies, when conceived broadly, provide fertile grounds for collaboration
between diverse disciplines interested in the changing dynamics of narrative,
interpretation, language, form, prosody, composition, dialog, discourse, story,
genre, authorship, influence, and text. It is in this core conceptual cluster
of operational terms that I want to locate a notion of poetics capable of
addressing not only the machinations of poetry and prose, but also of pixel,
code, string, script, inscription, list, document, file, record, project, and
archive.

Moreno on microanalysis!

Microanalysis opens the gap between text as it is embedded into storage media
and text as it is seen on the screen.

the closest possible kind of reading
that pays attention to the material contexts of knowledge production.

Such textual proliferation comes at a cost. Until recently, the bread and
butter of literary scholarship has been close reading. Close reading, like
critical thinking, is an idea more easily performed than explained, because the
details become contentious as soon as they are formalized.[^ln2-close] I will
tread carefully, therefore, by committing myself to a broad definition of close
reading that involves some notion of deliberate and reflective practice aimed
at deep comprehension. The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College
and Careers (PARCC), the organization responsible for the controversial
Common Core standards being implemented in schools across the United States
today, promotes close reading as "thorough," "methodical," and "analytical"
practice that "enables students to reflect on the meanings of individual words
and sentences; the order in which sentences unfold; and the development of
ideas over the course of the text, which ultimately leads students to arrive at
an understanding of the text as a whole" [@parcc_parcc_2012, 7]. The general
movement here is from "text" on the page to "work" (text as a whole, in the
language of the report). The model of textuality implicit in the institutional
project of close reading assumes an environment of received literary canons,
naturally accessible to the human intellect. For the duration of the "Gutenberg
galaxy," the age of print, a well-educated person might have been expected to
internalize some several hundred or perhaps thousands of major texts
constituting the canon. Close reading was honed to operate on that naturalized
scale.

The expansion of the textual field has radically increased the cognitive
demands of literary engagement. The pipeline between text and work has
lengthened considerably. On the one side, the matter of canon formation can no
longer be relegated to stable, long-term systems of social filtering. Seen from
the perspective of a literary interface, the database, the social stream, and
the search engine are tools for dynamic, "on the fly," generative
canon-formation. Consider the task of finding an unknown (to me) factoid
online, about philosophy in the times of Andalusian Spain, for example. Where
in the past I might have started with a subject catalog compiled by librarians,
today I construct a search query, using resources that I believe will return a
reasonably authoritative list of texts on the subject. The search engine, in
effect, replaces (or rather complements) centuries-long processes of
canon-formation. A near-instantaneous list of results now becomes my ephemeral,
but nevertheless authoritative, collection of relevant literature.

Each text in the returned list still requires the instrumentation of close,
analytical interpretation. However, the same discipline of critical and
reflective deliberation exercised on the level of an individual text needs to
also be exercised on the level of procedurally generated search engine results:
Where to search? Using what engine? How to construct the query? What are the
implicit biases of the system?  The academic question of canon-formation
transforms into a (not yet critical) practice of rapid, iterative, generative
canon-making. Whatever ideals motivate close reading between "text" and "work"
surely must drive the process on the level of dynamic corpus composition.

Examples of macroanalysis. The various practices of distant reading arise from
the condition in which canons are no longer accessible, in their entirety, to
the unaided (natural) human intellect. These include distant reading and
macroanalysis in literary studies [@jockers_macroanalysis_2013;
@moretti_distant_2013], culturomics in economy [@aiden_uncharted:_2014],
e-discovery in law [@scheindlin_electronic_2004; @scheindlin_electronic_2009],
automatic essay evaluation in education [@shermis_handbook_2013], and medical
informatics in medicine [@shortliffe_biomedical_2013], among others. At the
foundations of these nascent disciplines is a shared toolkit of statistical
natural language processing [@manning_foundations_1999; @jurafsky_speech_2008],
automatic summarization [@radev_centroid-based_2004; @nenkova_pyramid_2007],
machine learning [@rasmussen_gaussian_2006; @flach_machine_2012], network
analysis [@opsahl_node_2010; @szell_measuring_2010; @takhteyev_geography_2012],
and topic modeling [@wallach_topic_2006; @blei_probabilistic_2012].

Where distant reading perceives patterns across large-scale corpora,
microanalysis breaks literary systems down to their minute constituent
components.

![Micro, macro, and close reading.](images/micro.png)

Where distant reading and macroanalysis are concerned with text aggregates,
microanalysis, of the type suggested (but not carried out to its logical
conclusion) by Kittler and Latour and Woolgar, occupies the other side of the
text--work equation. Note that contrary to what one may intuit, distant reading
often happens prior to close reading and not the other way around. In most
cases, the reader must find the text before analyzing it. Canons, corpora,
collections, libraries, and archives are all aggregates that mediate the
process of discovery. Microanalysis, too, constitutes a study of mediation, but
on the level of physical minutiae otherwise not readily observed in cursory
exploration. The instruments of microanalysis may coincide with computational
tools, designed to find hidden patterns lurking above or beneath a given
document.[^ln2-iarkho] The micro-instrumentation might also include a
screwdriver, a binding needle, or a soldering iron: sharp tools that help to
pry open and to scrutinize otherwise magical textual black boxes.

The pre-modern model of literary transmission assumes relatively short physical
distances separating authors, texts, and readers. Were I to write these words
in front of you, on paper, I would simply pass the page into your hands. In
receiving this text, you could be fairly certain that no third party meddled in
the process of passing the note. When communicating in this way, it makes sense
to talk about notions of strong "authorial intent" and "fidelity to the
original," because authors and their works are thought to occupy the same
contiguous space and time. The advent of cheap mechanical reproduction of print
(for the sake of brevity let's say the printing press) has introduced a range
of devices that mediate between the author and the reader. Distance, time, and
mediation subsequently weaken facile notions of authorial fidelity or intent.
At the very least, we know that editorial practices, publishing markets, and
communication technologies can introduce an unintended element of noise into
the channel. At the maximal break down of the communication act, long-distance,
asynchronous communication is susceptible to "man-in-the-middle" attacks, by
which a third party maliciously alters the content of communication
[@needham_using_1978].

Changing material conditions of textual transmission push against familiar
literary critical ideas. For example, as the mechanical reproduction of print
weakens the material basis for authorship attribution, the notion of authorship
itself undergoes change. That is not say that the author is dead, as Barthes
would have it. Authors continue to live and to collect royalties from the sale
of their works. The weakening of the authorship function merely makes certain
ways of talking about things like "authorial intent" and "fidelity to the
original" difficult to sustain. Massively collaborative writing projects like
Wikipedia and procedural narrative generation (machine writing) further erode
ideas of authorial production based on individual human agency. Yet, it would
be a mistake to believe that the myth of autopoiesis (the literature that
"writes itself," writing that writes, discourse that speaks, etc.)[^ln2-varela]
can displace the myth of the author. A discipline of close attention to the
atomic particulars of encoding, transmission, storage, and the decoding of text
at the site if its application to the human condition ultimately aims to
reclaim subjective agency, in motion. This may seem strange at first: to
recover the subject in the physical minutiae of the literary--technological
encounter. Yet the point of contact is crucial, for it is here that the subject
seems to disappear, in a compressed moment of time that needs to be unpacked
with some precision.
