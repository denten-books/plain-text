# Chapter 2: Surface

`inscription, encoding, legibility`

I do not trust the text appearing before my eyes. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun calls
magnetic storage the "enduring ephemeral," which "creates unforeseen
degenerative links between humans and machines" [@chun_enduring_2008, 148]. If
the floating gate transistor,[^ln1-gate] where my text now lives, can be called
the enduring ephemeral, I will call my liquid crystal display, where the text
shows itself, fading persistence. This is not to believe that digital text can
transcend its material contexts. Only that it seems to drift from surface to
surface, beyond the field of vision, in ways that erode trust in the general
permanence of the literary system. If we are destined to dwell on surfaces, I
do not know to which surface to attach my attention: the screen or the floating
gate.

In Chapter One of *Plain Text*, we encountered the book as a device. I traced
the intellectual roots of the literary artifact to several ideas emerging at
the turn of the twentieth century. We saw it first as a formal device: a
technique for defamiliarizing or making strange habituated metaphors. We then
saw it as a literal device, related to the operation of universal Turing
machines. Finally, I argued that Turing machines themselves belong to the
history of the book, both in the lineage of thought about symbolic
interpretation and as mechanisms for their transmission.

Once we see the digital document in all of its forms for what it is, a
computational device, we can begin to come to terms with the simulated nature
of screen textuality. Ask yourself a simple question: Where does text reside?
In print, one can point to the page and be fairly certain of the answer: here,
on the page. Computation complicates matters significantly. One can point to
the screen, yet it would not be enough to say that the text *is* there. The
screen remains in flux. It is a site of temporary projection. The projection
emanates from the storage medium within, passing through multiple filters and
transformations on the way to the screen. We therefore observe the figure
stretch before us across at least two sites of inscription. The sign stretches
and splits, expressed in the configuration of magnetic pulse and circuit state
at one end and in the phases of liquid crystal on screen at the other. Both
locations afford distinct constraints to reading, writing, and interpretation.

Thus when Michael Heim refers to the "ephemeral quality" of the electronic text
or when Pamela McCorduck describes it as "impermanent, flimsy, malleable, [and]
contingent" they identify real-world attributes of digital inscription, at the
site of its projection. McCorduck tells the story of a rabbinate court, which,
when faced with the law prohibiting observant Jews from erasing God's name,
rule that words on the screen are not to be considered as writing, therefore
sanctioning erasure [@mccorduck_universal_1985, 51; also quoted
@heim_electric_1987, 192]. Conversely, when scholars like Johnna Drucker,
Katherine Hayles, and Matthew Kirschenbaum respond to Heim and company with
hardened materialism, they are also rightly describing properties of digital
inscription, but this time at the site of its archival immanence. The two camps
disagree because they speak neither of the same phenomenon nor at the same
site. The former group notices the ephemeral, transcendent state of the
projected word. The latter points instead to the "uniquely indelible nature of
magnetic storage" [@kirschenbaum_mechanisms_2008], to "drives, tapes, and
disks" as the "fundamental physical support" and "material substrates of
computing" [@drucker_performative_2013]. The hard drive and the screen
partition the sign between surface and depth, projection and archive.

Form and content lie flat on the printed page. Print interfaces are paper thin,
we might say. Ink adheres to paper in the way that pixels do not to screens.
The splintered sign complicates the traditional structuralist distinctions
between form and content. It occupies at least two distinct sites, each
entailing drastically differing accordances for reading, writing, and
interpretation. Were we to untangle the tightly wound coil of the circuit, we
would find ample distance between the hard drive and the screen. Where print is
flat, computed text resides at several levels and along multiple dimensions
[@halyes code is flat].

How did this multiplicity come to be? And what effect does it have on the life
of the mind? The purpose of this chapter is to open space between the visible
sign and the archived inscription. The structure of textual artifacts---from a
simple leaflet to a novel in multiple volumes---has remained remarkably stable
since the invention of movable type. One rarely finds a sentence that spans
several paragraphs, for example. Nor would a contemporary reader expect to find
pages of different length in the same tome. Long-standing historical
conventions guide the production of printed text. Semantic and decorative units
on a page exist within a strict hierarchy, so familiar to us as to become
almost invisible. No book of serious non-fiction will be typeset in cursive
font, for example. But unless something out of the ordinary attracts attention,
the reader will tend to gloss the "inconsequential" details of formatting in
favor of content. The material contexts of a well designed book fade from view
during reading.

For a few decades after the advent of magnetic storage media but before screen
technology, the outward shape of the sign disappeared altogether. It is
difficult to fathom now, but at the time after the introduction of magnetic
tape in the 1960s but before the wide-spread advent of cathode ray tube
displays in the 1980s, the typewriter operator and the computer programmer were
often expected to manipulate text blindly. Where the page or the punch card
gave immediate visual feedback, the combination of magnetic tape and screen
separated input from output. The word could be "processed" or altered with
codes that controlled attributes like indent size or justification *before*
committing ink to paper. A paper describing the popular IBM Magnetic Tape
Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST) introduced in 1964 describes the novelty of the
system as follows:

> It could be emphasized for the first time that the typist could type at
> "rough draft" speed, "backspace and strike over" errors, and not worry about
> the pressure of mistakes made at the end of the page [@may_ibm_1981, 742].

The IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC) further added a "programmable
control" unit to separate the input from the output. Final printing would be
accomplished by:

> mounting the original tape and the correction tape, if any, on the
> two-station reader output unit, setting the pitch, leading, impression
> control and dead key space of the composer unit to the desired values, and
> entering set-up instructions on the console control (e.g., one-station or
> two-station tape read, depending on whether the correction tape is present;
> line count instructions for the format control and space to be left for
> pictures, etc.; special format instructions; and any required control codes
> known to be omitted from the input tape. During printing, the operator
> changes type elements when necessary, loads paper as required, and makes and
> enters hyphenation decisions if justified copy is being printed
[@bishop_development_1968, 382].

The tape unit and the control unit thus intervene between the keyboard and the
printed page. The "final printing" combines roughly the "prepared copy" with
"control and reference codes" and "printer output" [@bishop_development_1968;
@may_ibm_1981]. The materials from the time often speak of three distinct human
operators that could be responsible for each stage of the production: one
entering the copy, one specifying the control codes, and one responsible for
handling the paper output. The machine operators could hypothetically work in
isolation from one another. The typist would see only elements of the copy; the
typesetter or the controller only formatting and control codes; and the printer
only the interpolated results.

!["Block diagram of MT/SC system [@bishop_development_1968, 381].](images/mt-sc.png)

Researchers working on these early IBM word processing machines saw the
separation of print into such distinct strata as one of their major
contributions to the history of print writ large. A consultant writing for the
*IBM Journal* in 1968 imagines the "evolution of composition" that proceeded
from handwriting, to wood engraving, movable type, letterpress, and, finally,
to the IBM MT/SC. "The IBM Selectric Composer provides a new approach to the
printing process in this evolution," he writes. He concludes to say that the
IBM Composer finally empowers the writer to once again write books "without the
assistance of specialists" [@frutiger, 10]. Marketing language aside, the
separation of the sign from its immediate material contexts constituted a major
milestone in the history of writing and textuality.

In this chapter, I would like to give a historical account of a letter's
passage from paper to pixel. The movement proceeds in three stages, as
illustrated by three specific devices: first the mechanization of type reached
its apogee in the telegraph at the end of the nineteenth century. With the
advent of telegraphy, "content" meant for humans began to intertwine with
"control codes" used to operate machines remotely. Second, where the ticker
tape and the punch card were still legible without specialized "reader"
devices, the invention of magnetic tape submerged the mixed stream of letters
and control codes into an inscrutable substance. Finally, by the mid-twentieth
century, the screen emerged to simulate a measure of legibility lost in the
transition.

Where does computed text reside? I offer the following three historical
preconditions for digital textuality. They are not meant as history, but rather
as signposts to mark the journey ahead. The schema proceeds roughly as follows:
first, content and control couple at the visible surface of removable storage
media (ticker tape and punch card); second, inscription splits into input and
output, retreating into magnetic storage; to reemerge at third and last on the
screen in the same guise, but also, as we suspect, somehow transformed: less
solid and concealing something beneath the phantasmal shell of its former
appearance.

As we embark to explore the consequences of computed text, I propose we keep
the following three landmark mechanisms in view as milestones along our
journey: Goldberg's *Controller*, the IBM *MT/SC*, and Engelbart's *Time Fob*.
In the first of these, text structure and machine control lie before us for
inspection. The second one is mute: a black slate. The last of these belongs to
what Peter Denning calls the "third generation" of computer systems---an
assemblage of storage, input, and output technologies that continue to shape
the contemporary human encounter with text today.[^ln1-denning] These devices
tell the story of a fracture.  Through them, a part of the sign fades from view
into an arrangement of magnetic charge and floating gate at the site of the
archive. Another part appears at the site of projection in the flicker of the
cathode ray and the flow of the liquid crystal.

## A. Teletype (Input)

First, a few words about telegraphy in general. The turn of the twentieth
century was a pivotal period in the history of computing and communications.
The advent of programmable media---punch cards and ticker tape---coupled
natural language alphabets with machine control code.[^ln1-loom] Reduced to
discrete and reliably reproducible alphabets, the so called "natural languages"
could now be converted into the modulation of electrical signal. Language in
such a transitive state became more mobile than ever before. It could be
transmitted efficiently across vast distances. Moreover, the mechanization of
type introduced new "control" characters into circulation, intended to affect
machine state changes at a distance. Initially, such state changes were simple:
"begin transmission," "sound error bell," "start new line." With time, these
control codes developed into what we now know as a programming language. At the
turn of the century, the language of people and the language of machines
entered into the same stream of communications.

As telegraphy spanned national boundaries, agreements were needed to
standardize conventions for equipment and message encoding
[@international_telegraph_union_journal_1899, 82-91]. Such agreements were
handled on a regional, ad-hoc basis until 1865, with the creation of the
International Telegraph Union (ITU). The International Telegraph Conference in
Paris, held between March 1 and May 17 of 1865, adopted, among other things,
the use of a modified Morse code character set, containing 33 Latin letters
(including characters from the French, German, and Spanish alphabets), 10
numbers (0--9), 14 punctuation marks (including a fraction bar), and 10 control
codes (including "end of service," "attention," and "error")
[@international_telegraph_union_documents_1865]. In specifying the conversion
tables for the Morse alphabet, the 1865 ITU rules required a silence equal to
three dots (same as one dash) to indicate the space between two letters, and a
silence equivalent to four dots (later changed to seven) to indicate the space
between words.

Although Morse code can be expressed in terms of ones and zeros (binary), it is
technically a ternary code making use of at least three elements: dots, dashes,
and silences of various length. Furthermore, note that in Morse code a single
letter could be expressed as a series of dots and dashes of variable length:
from one dash that stands for letter "t" to six dots that stand for the number
six. The transmission of variable length codes required the presence of a human
operator who could "translate" form natrual language to the machine alphabet,
using a "key" which when depressed vertically would complete an electrical
curcuit to produce the signal. Writing in 1929 for the journal *American
Speech*, Hervey Brackbill preserved some of the specialized language associated
with Morse code culture. "Morse telegraphy is commonly referred to as a 'game,'
and the operator 'works a wire,'" he wrote. An operator tapping a key "uses a
bug." "The first instruments," Brackbill wrote, "with their long slender levers
and springs, looked very much like a sprawling bug." They have trade names like
"Lighting Bug," "Gold Bug," and "Cootie" (for a small model)
[@brackbill_telegraphers_1929, 287-288]. Operators using "straight keys"
practically achieved speeds upwards of 25--30 words per minute, limited by the
shortest possible length of the smallest transmitted unit (a dot), fixed by the
American and the International Morse Code conventions to 1/24 of a second in
duration.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, companies like Western Electric,
Mecograph, and Vibroplex began manufacturing semi-automatic keys, which made
use of a horizontal switch capable of emitting a rapid succession of dots to
one side of the action, and dashes to the other [@martin_telegraphic_1904;
@boyd_telegraph-key_1916]. A bug was said to "run away" when adjusted for too
high of a speed. The Vibroplex keys would significantly alter the "fist," or
the transmission style of the operator, allowing for speeds that approached 50
words per minute (and above, if not following the minimum signal length
specifications) [@mcnicol_american_1913, 207;
@u.s._bureau_of_labor_statistics_displacement_1932; @halstead_genesis_1949].
Despite the improvements, Morse code was showing its age. Although the
convention stipulated fixed length, the actual length of the silence between
the meaning-carrying units of Morse code could vary greatly with the vagrancies
of the transmitting medium. Cross talk between wires and weather interferences
were common, which meant that communicating in Morse still required a human
operator for efficient ciphering and deciphering of the transmisison. In a
long-chain of mediation telegraph operator, code, and machine, the human posed
a limiting factor.

Telegraph operators working a "hand sender" commonly developed partial
paralysis of wrist or arm, commonly known as a "glass arm"
[@brackbill_telegraphers_1929;
@u.s._bureau_of_labor_statistics_displacement_1932]. A sender was called a
"ham" or a "bum" when he "fell down" or made errors in sending. To "put someone
under the table" in sender's lingo was to transmit faster that the receiver
ability to transcribe. The "reader" was "burnt up" when he fell behind. He had
to "break," or interrupt the sender to ask for repetition. To "paste" someone
meant to transmit at high speeds to deliberately burn him up or put him under
the table [@brackbill_telegraphers_1929].

The International Telegraph Conference in Lisbon, held in the summer of 1908,
ratified two additional alphabet standards for international use: Hughes and
Baudot. Both developed in response to the limitations of Morse, allowing for
fully autonomous telegraph operation.

![Table of Alphabets, 1901 [@vansize_new_1901, 23].](images/alphabets-vansize.png)

This new generation of printing telegraphs could be "programmed" using
removable storage media, in a way that a player piano is "programmed" to play a
piece by means of a music roll. The printing telegraph decoupled the act of
writing and reading from the act of transmission, similar to the way the
perforated music roll decouples the act of playing the piano from the
performance. Using external storage media like ticker tape and punch cards, a
message could be prepared in advance and "fed" into the mechanism for
transmission at rates far exceeded the possibilities of hand-operated Morse
telegraphy. Unlike the Morse alphabet which varied in length, the Baudot in
particular fixed the length of the encoding to five spaces or "bits." Five
"off" and "on" spaces allowed for 2^5=32 permutations. After encoding the
common Latin characters, the schema left space for several special "control"
characters. The "character space" could further be expanded by switching the
receiving mechanism into a special "control mode" in which every combination of
five bits represented an individual control character (instead of a letter).

The invention of fixed-length ciphers lies in the sixth book of Francis Bacon's
*De augmentis scientiarum* (*Division of the Sciences*),[^ln1-bacon] an
encyclopedic treatise on the "partition of sciences" written in the form of a
letter to King James in 1623. Book Six of Bacon's systematic account of the
sciences is dedicated to speech, speaking, writing, grammar (literary and
philosophical), poetry (meter and verse), and, most relevant to our discussion,
"the knowledge of ciphers." Here Bacon boasts of inventing a "highest degree of
cipher" that can signify "all in all" (*omnia per omnia*). Bacon proceeded to
describe a "fivefold," "bi-literarie" alphabet, which encodes each letter of
the English language using a five-letter long string of As and Bs. The letter
A, for example, became "aaaaa." B became "aaaab," C "aaaba," and so on to Z,
rendered as "babbb." "Neither is this a small matter," Bacon wrote:

> These Cypher-Characters have, and may performe: For by this *Art* a way is
opened, whereby a man may expresse and signifie the intentions of his minde, at
any distance of place, by objects which may be presented to the eye, an
accommodated to the eare: provided those objects be capable of a twofold
difference only; as by Bells, by Trumpets, by Lights and Torches, by the
report of Muskets, an any instruments of like nature [@bacon_advancement_1987,
266].

Writing near two centuries after the advent of the Gutenberg press, Bacon
perceived the essence of telegraphy: to express and to signify the intentions
of the human mind at a distance. The Morse and the Baudot codes paved the way
for the automation of human language. The great proliferation of scripts and
alphabets was finally reduced to thirty-two discrete and reproducible
characters. So regularized, type could be converted into electrical signal,
sent over great distances, and used to program machines remotely. The price for
these new affordances given to language was legibility. The translation between
human alphabet and machine transmittable code required first a cadre of
specially trained machine operators, and then specialized equipment which
automated the process of translation itself.

As Bacon's early writings on the language arts suggest, the roots of telegraphy
lie in cypher-making and cryptography. For this reason, the encoding of human
languages for machine use was always intimately connected to war-time,
diplomatic, and otherwise secret communications. The seemingly innocuous
problem of machine translation was therefore from the beginning intertwined
with the question of access and legibility: who gets to understand the encoded
message and when? For example, the Final Protocol to the Telegraph Regulations,
ratified in Madrid in 1932 by the governments of more than seventy countries
including Germany, Brazil, Cuba, Egypt, Empire d'Ethiopie, France, Japan, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain, United States of America, and Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, included a special provision delineating the difference
between transmitting "plain," and "secret" language. The protocols further
grouped "secret languages" into "code" and "cypher" categories. According to
the language of the protocol, "plain language" was that "which presents an
intelligible meaning in one or more of the languages authorized for
international telegraph correspondence, each word and each expression having
the meaning normally assigned to it in the language to which it belongs"
[@itu_telegraph_1932, 12]. By contrast, the regulations specified "code
language" as text "composed either of artificial words, or of real words not
used in the meaning normally assigned to them in the language to which they
belong and consequently not forming intelligible phrases" [@itu_telegraph_1932,
12]. Codes were not permitted to contain more than five characters and were
   charged at 6/10th of the agreed tariff rate. Upon request, the sender of the
telegram in code language was required to "produce the code from which the text
or part of the text of the telegram has been compiled" [@itu_telegraph_1932,
13]. Otherwise, the language was considered to be a secret "cypher," defined as
   "groups or series of Arabic figures with a secret meaning."

According to the terms of the convention, all administrations agree to accept
and to pass telegrams in plain language through their jurisdiction. The
undesigned agreed also to allow secret communication to pass in transit through
their territory, although they were allowed also to refuse to admit them "both in
acceptance and in delivery" [@itu_telegraph_1932, 13].

A number of American patents at the dusk of Morse age attempted to address the
challenge of illegibility of machine code. Code obscured intended meaning,
which in international communication had implications for national security.
But code also presented a barrier to human understanding. It was was difficult
to encode and to decode without special training. "You must acknowledge that
this is readable without special training," reads the caption to a schematic
illustration for a "controller," patented by H.E. Goldberg in 1911. "My
invention relates to all controllers," Goldberg writes. The object of
Goldberg's controller was "to provide a mechanism operable by a control sheet
which is legible to every person having sufficient education to enable him to
read." Goldberg illustrates his invention in attaching to his patent "a control
sheet in which the control characters are in the form of the letters of the
ordinary English alphabet" [@goldberg_controller_1915]. Rather than using
ticker tape, Goldberg proposed the use of perforations that while capable of
actuating machine levers also formed letters. To counteract the
unintelligibility of code, Goldberg imagines using cards, perforated in the
shape of the English alphabet. Thus besides carrying human-readable content,
Goldberg's cards did "double duty" to mechanically manipulate the machine's
"blocks," "handles," "terminal blades," and "plungers"
[@goldberg_controller_1915].  On Goldberg's control sheets, the language of
machines and the language of humans coincided at one and the same plane.

![Goldberg's Control Cards [@goldberg_controller_1915].](images/control-2.png)

By the late 1920s the "Morse men" were being replaced with more efficient
automated devices. By the 1930s, devices variously known as "printer
telegraphs," "teletypewriters," and "teletypes" displaced Morse code telegraphy
as the dominant mode of commercial communication. The monthly "Labor Review"
report published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in March of 1932
estimates more than a 50 percent drop in the number of Morse code operators
between the years of 1915 and 1931. Morse operators referred to the
tele-typists on the sending side as "punchers" and on the receiving side as
"printer men."[^ln1-printermen] The printer men responsible for assembling
pages from ticker tape were called "pasters" and sometimes, derisively, as
"paperhangers" [@brackbill_telegraphers_1929]. Where Morse code telegraphy
required the mediation of a human-operator responsible for translating language
into code, teletype automated the process entirely. The operator could simply
enter printed characters into the machine directly, using a keyboard similar to
the typewriter, by that time widely in business use. The teletype would then
automatically transcode the input into transmitted signal and then back from
the signal onto paper on the receiving end. Operators did not need to concern
themselves with machine code at all. They saw only the familiar alphabet
letters.

With the advent of the automated telegraph, content meant for people was now
routinely being intermixed with code meant to control machine devices remotely.
Such remote control capabilities were used for everything from programming
radio stations to advertising billboards and knitting machines
[@hough_wired_1931; @adler_knitting_1933; @casper_remote_1934]. Early
paper-based storage media, from Morse code-based ticker tape systems, to the
telegraphs of Hughes and Baudot, and to punch cards that powered weaving looms,
player pianos, and census tabulators coupled natural language with machine
control. The concern with the legibility of machine code emerges during the
first few decades of the twentieth century. For the first time in the history
of writing, the alphanumerical sign splits between human- and machine- readable
inscription. For a time, the inscription remains visible at the surface of the
control sheet, as perforated figure, punched through the medium. 

The era of ticker tape punch cards can be thought to end with the mass-market
introduction of IBM's Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typewriter in 1964. Magnetic
storage media further submerges the inscription beneath an inscrutable facade.

[^ln1-printermen]: According to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics, women
comprised 24 percent of Morse operators in 1915 (before the wide-spread advent
of automated telegraphy). By 1931 women comprised 64 percent of printer and
Morse manual operators [@u.s._bureau_of_labor_statistics_displacement_1932,
514].

## B. Magnetic tape (Storage)

"Historically unforeseen, barely a thing, software's ghostly presence produces
and defies apprehension," Wendy Chun wrote in her *Programmed Visions*, an
influential monograph that continues to shape the field of software studies.
She quotes several prominent computer scientists and media historians to the
same effect. But what gives software its ephemeral quality? Embossed onto
ticker tape or punched into the card, early software protrudes through the
medium. In the age of the telegraph, the biggest barrier to the comprehension
of software was encoding. Morse code and similar alphabet conventions left a
visible mark on the paper. Once the machine alphabet identified, it could be
translated back into natural language.

Early programmable media could hardly be called ephemeral or immaterial.
Anecdotes circulate in the digital humanities circles of Father Roberto Busa,
the early pioneer in the field of computational philology, carting his punch
cards around Italy on a truck in the 1960s.[^ln2-busa] Code before its
electromagnetic period was burdensome, fragile, unwieldy, and, most of all,
visible.

The principles of magnetic recording were developed by Oberlin Smith (among
others), the American engineer who also filed several inventions related to
weaving looms at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1888, inspired by
Edison's mechanical phonograph, Smith made public his experiments with an
"electrical method" of sound recording using a "magnetized cord" (cotton mixed
with hardened steel dust) as a recording medium. These experiments were later
put into practice by Valdemar Poulsen of Denmark, who patented several
influential designs for a magnetic wire recorder [@smith_possible_1888;
@poulsen_method_1900; @engel_1888-1988_1988; @thiele_magnetic_1988;
@daniel_magnetic_1998; @vasic_coding_2004].

Magnetic recording on wire or plastic tape offered several advantages over
mechanical perforation. It was more durable than paper, it could fit more
information per square inch, and, most importantly, it was reusable. "One of
the important advantages of magnetic recording is that the record may be erased
if desired, and a new record made in its place," Marvin Camras, a physicist
with the Armour Research Foundation writes in 1948 [@camras, 505]. At the turn
of the century, most of the developments in magnetic storage were aimed at
sound recording. The use of magnetic medium for the storage of data did not
take off in earnest until the 1950s [@dee, 1775]. Yet some of the early
engineers advancing electro-magnetic storage and recording technology already
conceived of their work as having impact on knowledge production broadly and on
the history of the book in particular. Addressing the Franklin Institute on
December 16th of 1908 Charles Fankhauser, the inventor of the electromagnetic
"telegraphone," said the following:

> To transport human speech over a distance of one thousand miles is a
> wonderful achievement. How much more wonderful, then, is the achievement that
> makes possible [...] its storage at the receiving end, so that the exact
> sentence, the exact intonation of the voice, the exact timbre may be
> reproduced over and over again, an endless number of times"
[@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 39]

Comparing magnetic recording to the invention of the Gutenberg press,
Fankhauser went on to say:

> It is my belief that what type has been to the spoken word, the telegraphone
> will be to the electrically transmitted word [...] As printing spread
> learning and civilization among the peoples of the earth and influenced
> knowledge and intercourse among men, so I believe the telegraphone will
> influence and spread electrical communication among men"
[@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 40].

In that speech, Fankhauser laments what he calls the "evanescence" of telegraph
and telephone communications. The telephone fails to preserve "an authentic
record of the conversion over the wire" [@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 40].
Fankhauser imagines his telegraphone in use by "the sick, the infirm, and the
aged:"

> A book can be read to the sightless or the invalid by the machine, while the
patient lies in bed. Lectures, concerts, recitations---what one wishes, may be
had at will. Skilled readers or expert elocution teachers could be employed to
read into the wires entire libraries [@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 44].

Anticipating the popularity of twenty-first century audio media formats like
the podcast and the audio book, Fankhauser imagines "tired and jaded" workers
who "sooth themselves into a state of restfulness" by listening to their
favorite authors. Poulsen's "electric writing" will finally emerge "as clear
and as distinct as the writing by hand, an absolutely legal and conclusive
record" [@fankhauser_telegraphone_1909, 41].

The use of magnetic tape for data storage and processing begins in earnest in
the 1950s. For example, the state of the art relay calculator commissioned by
the Bureau of Ordinance of the Navy Department in 1944 and built by the Harvard
Computation laboratory in 1947 still made use of standard telegraph "tape
readers and punchers," adapted for computation with the aid of engineers from
Western Union Telegraph Company [@staff_description_1949, 1-40].[^ln2-punch]
The relay calculator was equipped with a number of Teletype Model 12A tape
readers and Model 10B perforators, using 11/16-inch wide paper tape with "five
intelligence holes." The readers and punches were capable of operating at 600
operations per minute. Four Model 15 Page-Printers gave the means to compare
the printed characters with the digits stored in the ticker tape-based
controlling print register. In this setup, the numerical inscription was
therefore already split between input and output channels: with input stored on
ticker tape and output on the printed page, for verification.

The next generation Mark III Calculator, commissioned by the Navy's Bureau of
Ordinance in 1948 and completed in 1950 at Harvard jettisoned tape in favor of
magnetic drum and tape. The drum provided for limited but fast "internal"
storage, where the tape was slower but easily swapped and extended to many
reels. The surface of the magnetic drums was coated with a "thin film composed
of finely divided magnetic oxides of iron suspended in a plastic lacquer, and
applied to the drums with an artist's air brush" [@staff_description_1952, 1].
The machine used twenty-five such drums, rotating at 6900 rpm and each capable
of storing 240 binary digits. In addition to the fast "internal storage" drums,
the "floor plan" included eight slow "external storage" tape-read mechanisms.
Following the Turing model, the tapes extended the storage capabilities of the
machine. Operators could prepare tape with information that would then make its
way onto the internal magnetic drums for for data calculation and machine
sequencing and control. Mark III was further equipped with five printers "for
presenting computed results in a form suitable for publication. The printers
were capable of determining the "number of digits to be printed, the
intercolumnar and interlinear spacing, and other items related to the
typography of the printed page" [@staff_description_1952, 1-40].

Data was recorded on tape using binary numerical notation. To enter the number
onto tape, the operator used the "numerical tape preparation table," an actual
piece of furniture separate from the main machine. The data was stored on tape
along two channels, running the length of the tape. The operator entered each
number twice, first into Channel A and then into Channel B. This was done to
prevent errors, since the operator worked blindly, without being able to see
whether the intended mark registered properly on magnetic tape. An error bell
would sound if the first quantity did not match the second, in which case the
operator would have to reenter the mismatched digits [@staff_description_1952,
143-88]. To further "ensure completely reliable results" the operator could
use one of the five attached Underwood Electric teletypes to print all of the
tape's columns and confirm visually.

I cover significant technical detail above to make sure that the contemporary
reader understands what I describe as the "splitting of the sign" or the
"multiple locations of the inscription" not as a metaphor, but literally. Where
the typewriter or the whole punch transfered the inscription from keyboard to
paper directly, at the stroke of hammer and key, early electromagnetic devices
compounded the inscription across multiple surfaces. The movement of the
computed sign necessitated multiple "phase transitions" between media: from
drum to tape, from one channel of the tape to another, and from tape to paper.
Upon key press, the sign disappears from view, onto a magnetic surface that
resists direct observation. The computed sign was displaced in time and space,
undergoing a number of transformations in the process. These transformations in
effect constitute what we mean by the "processing" part of "word processing."
In the first stage of its development, the processed sign mixes with machine
control code. In the second stage, it disappears from view.

Advances in magnetic storage in the field of audio recording and in
supercomputer applications like the Mark III found their way into the business
and home offices a decade later, in the 1960s. In 1964, IBM combined magnetic
tape storage with its *Selectric* line of electric typewriters, introducing the
Magnetic Tape Selectric (MT/ST) line of typewriters to the mass market. Writing
for the *Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science* in 1992, Daniel
Eisenberg mentions the MT/ST as one of the first word processors, defined by
the ability to record strokes and to print them onto paper *as a separate
operation* [@eisenberg_word_1992]. Built on a simpler architecture than its
supercomputer cousins, the MT/ST used a single tape read/write mechanism. An
advertisement in the American Bar Association circa 1968 calls it the $10,000
typewriter that "is worth every penny." Before, the typist would have to stop
and erase every mistake, the copy reads. But with IBM MT/ST it is possible to
to "backspace, retype, and keep going." The mistake is changed on magnetic
tape, "where all typing is recorded and played back correctly at incredible
speed" [@aba 1966, 998]. But just as it was with Mark III, the data stored on
the magnetic tape was absolutely invisible to the typist. At the time, the only
way to verify the magnetic inscription was to print it out.

What was gained in the freeing of text from the confines of immutable media
like ink and paper, was gotten at the price of legibility.  Encoding used by
the IBM MT/ST typewriter retained the familiar underlying structure of a 7-bit
encoding scheme, not dissimilar from Bacon's secret writing. But on tape, the
encoding scheme ceased to be recoverable by the naked eye. The inscription lay
literally beyond human sense. On tape, "magnetic domains" and "polarities"take
place of visible alphabets.[^ln2-magnet] The developers of these early systems
recognized the problem of congruence between the visible and the invisible
sign. The machine operator needed to ensure that the input correspond to the
stored quantity. But the only way to check the stored quantity was to once
again transform it into another inscription. Direct access to the site of
storage was near-impossible.

The engineers working on Mark III attempted to address the problem of
congruence by asking the operator to input quantities twice. Other solutions
included making the magnetic mark more visible. For example, the "magnetic
reader" patented by Robert Youngquist and Robert Hanes in 1962 promised a
"device for visual observation of magnetic symbols recorded on a magnetic
recording medium in tape or sheet form." Youngquist and Hanes wrote:

> Magnetic recording tape is often criticized because the recorded signals are
invisible, and the criticism has been strong enough to deny it certain
important markets. For example, this has been a major factor in hampering sales
efforts at substituting magnetic recording tape and card equipment for punched
tape and card equipment which presently is dominant in automatic digital
data--handling systems. Although magnetic recording devices are faster and more
troublefree, potential customers have often balked at losing the ability to
check recorded information visually. It has been suggested that the information
be printed in ink alongside the magnetic signals, but this vitiates major
competitive advantages of magnetic recording sheet material, e.g., ease in
correction, economy in reuse, simplicity of equipment, compactness of recorded
data, etc." [@youngquist_magnetic_1961, 1]

The magnetic reader comprised a flat box that resembles a book. Youngquist and
Hanes proposed to fill the cover plate of their box with a transparent liquid
to host "visible, weakly ferromagnetic crystals." When sandwiched between the
two plates, a piece of magnetic tape would activate the crystals to align with
the embedded inscription. In this way, the top plate would reveal the "visible
outlines" of the underlying magnetic symbol [@youngquist_magnetic_1961, 1].

associated with this unit, under manual control. Second, as suitable contol
tape may be coded directing the calculator to compute the values of *f(x)* and
record them by means of one of th efour output punches, mounted on the right
wing of the machine" [@staff_description_1949, 34].

## C. Screen, (Output)

By decoupling input and output, magnetic storage and solid state media afford
the injection of time and space, in arbitrary intervals, between the process of
inscription and comprehension. Content, coupled with control code, sinks
beneath the matte surface of electrical charge. The final movement in the
emergence of automated discourse reintroduces the illusion of immediacy into
the process of inscription. Text, invisible in its material substratum,
reappears on the screen, but, crucially, it no longer corresponds to its mirror
inscription. This property is as perilous as it is liberating: perilous,
because the flows of power and control can now be submerged under the
shimmering surface of the screen, and liberating, because loosely coupled to
their material substratum texts become both more fluid and more portable.
Plainly put, the systematic barriers to copying, sharing, exchanging, editing,
remixing, and disseminating texts are reduced to a minimum.

Ersatz skeuomorphism (between disk storage and screen image) leads to the
reception of digital text as an ephemeral artifact. With the illusory role of
the screen in mind, I propose 1968 as the year in which the contemporary
textual condition takes its present form. On December 9, 1968 Douglas
Engelbart, then founder and primary investigator at the NASA- and ARPA-funded
Augmentation Research Center lab at the Stanford Research Institute, gave what
later became known colloquially as "the mother of all demos
[@tweney_mother_2008]" before an audience of roughly one thousand or so
computer professionals attending the Fall Joint Computer Conference held at the
Convention Center in San Francisco [@rogers_demo_2005]. The demo announced the
arrival of almost every technology prophesied by Vannevar Bush in his
influential 1945 piece for *The Atlantic* [@bush_as_1945]. Speaking a little
over an hour,  through a headset, in a prerecorded address, Engelbart features
functional (live) prototypes of the following: graphical user interfaces, video
conferencing, remote camera monitoring, links and hypertext, version control,
text search, image manipulation, windows-based user interfaces, digital slides,
networked machines, mouse, stylus, and joystick inputs, and "what you see is
what you get" (WYSIWYG) word processing.

!["NOW IS THE TIME FOB." Schematics for a "display system" [@engelbart_x-y_1970].](images/engel.png)

In his report to NASA, which sponsored research on "intellect augmentation"
along with DARPA, Engelbart describes his lab as a group of scientists
"developing an experimental laboratory around an interactive, multiconsole
computer-display system" and "working to learn the principles by which
interactive computer aids can augment the intellectual capability of the
subjects" [@engelbart_human_1969, 1]. Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays were
central to this research mission. In one of many patents that came out of
"intellect augmentation" laboratory, Engelbart pictures the "display system" as
a workstation that combines a typewriter, a CRT, and a mouse. The system is
frozen in mid-action, with the words "THE TIME IS NOW FOB" prominently
displayed on the screen. Although Engelbart does not explain the message, the
system's user is evidently in the process of editing a sentence and about to
correct the nonsensical FOB into a FOR. Engelbart writes, "One of the
potentially most promising means for delivering and receiving information to
and from digital computers involves the display of computer outputs as visual
representation on a cathode ray tube and the alternation of the display by
human operator in order to deliver instructions to the computer"
[@engelbart_x-y_1970].

The CRT closes the circuit between human and machine, with a few caveats. In
practice, the short-lived screen-less word processors (like the IBM MT/ST)
necessitated for the cognitively arduous task of continuously keeping the
underlying document structure in the mind's eye. The CRT lifts that burden by
unfolding the structure topographically, allowing for spatial navigation along
the document---restoring, in a sense, the natural affordances of print. Data
becomes visible again. Moreover, represented in the shimmer of the cathode ray,
it attaches itself lightly to the retina. Users trying out this way of writing
for the first time report that the screen liberates them from the material
confines of print textuality. One user, possibly Engelbart himself, writes the
following:[^ln2-follow]

[^ln2-follow]: I reproduce the text verbatim and preserving the line breaks,
since formatting is an important part of the reported experience.

```
    1B2B1 "To accommodate and preserve a thought or
    piece of information that isn't related to the work
    of the moment, one can very quickly and easily
    insert a note within the structure of a file at such
    a place that it will nether get in the way nor get
    lost.

    1B2B2 "Later, working in another part of the file,
    he can almost instantly (e.g. within two seconds)
    return to the place where he temporarily is storing
    such notes, to modify or add to any of them.

    1B2B3 "As any such miscellaneous thought develops,
    it is easy (and delightful) to reshape the structure
    and content of its discussion material.
```

Engelbart, interested in collecting empirical phenomenological accounts of the
system, records what must count as several of the most evocative passages to
appear on the pages of a NASA technical report. In the "Results and Discussion"
section an anonymous user continues to report:

```
1B4 "I find that I can express myself better, if I can
make all the little changes and experiments with wording
and structure as they occur to me." [Here the user
experiments a little with using structural decomposition
of a complex sentence.]
```

A deconstruction indeed follows, as the author begins to deviate from the
conventions of the technical report. The numbered passages, and unexpected
enjambment, heightens the staccato quality of the prose, which at times reaches
towards the lyric:


```
    1B4A "I find that I write faster and more freely,

        1B4A1 "pouring thoughts and trial words on the
        screen with much less inhibition,

        1B4A2 "finding it easy to repair mistakes or wrong
        choices

            1B4A22 "so while capturing a thought I don't
            have to inhibit the outpouring of thought and
            action to do it with particular correctness,

        1B4A3 "finding that several trials at the right
        wording can be done very quickly

            1B4A3A "so I can experiment, easily take a look
            and see how a new version strikes me--and often
            the first unworried attempt at a way to express
            something turn out to be satisfactory, or at
            least to require only minor touch up.

        1B4A4 "Finding that where I might otherwise
        hesitate in search of the right word, I now pour out
        a succession of potentially appropriate words,
        leaving them all the while the rest of the
        statement takes shape. Then I select from among
        them, or replace them all, or else merely change the
        list a it and wait for a later movement of the
        spirit.
```

When input and output coincide in time, as they do on paper, mistakes can be
costly. The writer must commit to making an inscription and, once made, the
inscription gains permanence in a way that is difficult to correct. One can
erase, removing a layer of physical material, or cover up, adding a layer of
white ink to repair the damage. Engelbart's anonymous writer reports a feeling
of freedom from such commitment to physical medium. He or she can simply
"backspace" and start over. The contemporary reader may take such things for
granted now, but imagine trying to write in that way for the first time.
Writing "comes easy," becomes "uninhibited," and it "pours out" experimentally.
Rather than manipulate language mentally, the writer "pours" the words onto the
screen and then "selects" the right one, without hesitation. The highly
hierarchical and blocky paragraph structure, along with its repetitive refrain,
"finding" and "I find that," gives the prose a hypnotic drive forward, which
matches the reported experience of liberation. Anonymous continues:

```
    1B4B "I find that,

        1B4B1 "being much more aware of

            1B4B1A "the relationships among the phrases of a
            sentence,

            1B4B1B "among the statements of a list,

            1B4B1C "and among the various level and members
            of a branch,

        1B4B2 "being able

            1B4B2A "to view them in different ways,

            1B4B2B "to rearrange them easily,

            1B4B2C "to experiment with certain special
            portrayals,

                1B4B2C1 "not available easily in unstructured data

                1B4B2C2 "or usable without the CRT display,

        1B4B3 "and being aware that

            1B4B3A "I can (and am seeking to) develop still
            further special conventions and computer aids

            1B4B3B "to make even more of this available and
            easy,

        1B4B4 "all tend to increase

            1B4B4A "my interest and experimentation

            1B4B4B "and my conviction that this is but a
            peek at what is to come soon.
```

The passages are too contrived to be spontaneous admissions of phenomenological
experience. Despite the experimental structure, the passages contain a
well-formed rhetorical message advancing key elements of Engelbart's research
program, which aimed to develop new data structures in combination with new
ways of displaying them. Yet I cannot help but be carried away by the fluency
of the prose and by the sheer audacity of the project. Here's someone who has
not only glimpsed the future, but has also brought it into being. The
contemporary author can drag and drop passages around with more facility, but
he has not himself structured his cognitive environment. In Engelbart's terms,
someone else has augmented the author's intellect, in ways that may or may not
fit the individual psyche. That feeling of effortless textuality cannot
therefore be taken at face value, by the unreliable phenomenological accounts
alone. To bring his system into being, Engelbart convened what he called a
"bootstrap community," which through recursive self-improvement could lift
itself up towards a smarter, more efficient, and as the report's lexicon
betrays, a more human way of working. To accomplish this, the group crafted
novel instruments for input and output. They wrote new programming languages,
compilers to interpret them, and debuggers to troubleshoot. They invented word
editors and format control languages. Here's how Engelbart diagrams a *part* of
his text-manipulation language in the same report:

!["State--chart portrayal of part of text--manipulation control language"
[@engelbart_human_1969, 36].](images/engel-edit.png)

The diagram shows much attention to the detail of and love for the writing
craft. But there is also much complexity. It is near impenetrable. In building
their own tools, Engelbart's team lifted themselves up by the bootstraps. But
it was not the machine that lifted them up---it was the process of creating the
machine. The very metaphor of bootstrapping suggests the impossibility of using
one's bootstraps to pull others out of the Platonic cave. As a side effect of
that effort, text, before readily apparent on the page, now enters a complex
system of executable code and control structure. The perception of material
lightness of textual being comes at the price of legibility. Would new authors
find the same ease in the complication of the mechanism? I suspect not unless
they become an active part of a "bootstrapping community" of their own.

non-representational communication, suggested by early experiments in direct
brain-to-brain or brain-to-machine interfaces.

## WYSINAWYG (What You See Is Not Always What You Get)

In presenting canonical models of document structure, it is my hope to convince
the reader of the very real and literal sense of depth manufactured into the
structure of the contemporary Document Object Model. This includes print,
because even in that mode, publishing practices today rely on some of the same
machinery described in this chapter.

The gap between input and output is what gives rise to the ephemeral quality of
digital text. Temporary storage media located on the way from keyboard to page
or screen allows for rapid and frequent remediation. It keeps the ink in motion
unattached to a "sticky" medium like paper. However, the spatial elongation of
the sign also comes at a cost. Submerged in the passage between keyboard and
screen or paper, the inscription passes from view. In its ephemeral "liquid"
form it is also no longer legible to the naked human eye. It reappears again on
the screen or page already "processed," that is, altered by the intervention of
the "control unit." Writing or reading on a device can thus no longer remain a
solitary activity. Machine operators far removed from the site of
interpretation intervene to mediate the encounter between reader/writer, and
text.

The consequences of that intervention are immense. With time, supplemental
"control characters" designed to format documents fused with programming
languages, capable of generalized device control. Technological and legal
fictions rise to restore a measure of "stickiness" to text in its ephemeral
form. For example, manufacturers commonly embed digital rights management
circuits into video streaming devices to artificially limit the duplication of
broadcast material. Similarly, electronic book sellers often prevent readers
from copying and pasting words on the page. Such measures mimic some of the
constraints associated with static, paper-and-ink-bound media regimes.
Essential for the practices of unencumbered critical thought, control
structures exist in the hidden gap between the two parts of the splintered
sign. Ultimately, the "control" layer is capable of affecting more than print
design. It shapes the very structure of interpretation. In the language of the
Document Object Model, the formatting layer contains the essence of "machine
control." Long a marginal concept in literary theory, formatting is therefore
central to the practice of computational hermeneutics. Far from mere
inconsequential embellishment, formatting governs the interface between meaning
and matter, thought and page. It has the capability to embellish, to obscure,
to censor, to govern, and to emend.

The attached documents illustrate my thesis in practice. In the first image the
reader will find a visual "dotplot" representation of Laurence Sterne's *The
Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy*, in plain text (`.txt`) file format. To
produce the image, I use the Helfman's self-similarity dotplot approach. Dotplots,
as Helfman explains, "reveal similarity structures in data regardless of format
and in text and software regardless of language" [@helfman_dotplot_1996]. They
can be used for authorship identification, plagiarism detection, or to find
similarity in genetic material. The following, is a simple dotplot from
Shakespeare:

+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+
|    |to |be |or |not |to |be |
+====+===+===+===+====+===+===+
|to  | • |   |   |    | • |   |
+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+
|be  |   | • |   |    |   | • |
+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+
|or  |   |   | • |    |   |   |
+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+
|not |   |   |   | •  |   |   |
+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+
|to  | • |   |   |    | • |   |
+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+
|be  |   | • |   |    |   | • |
+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+

Table: "Six words of Shakespeare." @helfman_dotplot_1996

When applied to raw, binary data, self-similarity plots can be used to study
data structures, to identify security threats, and to reverse engineer unknown
file types. Note that, at this level, we are not observing patterns of meaning
(as repetition of words or word clusters), but rather structural patterns in
the underlying bit structure. We cannot tell from the image what these types
mean, only that they are structured in a particular way. Structure, in this
sense indicates architecture by human hand. We expect random, encoded or
encrypted, data to render as undifferentiated patternless noise. Different file
formats, like the common `.docx` and `.mobi` will therefore leave a
recognizable signature, even when corrupted. The sparse topography of the
`.txt` file in the first image indicates a relative paucity in bit types. Plain
text formats are limited to human-legible UTF-8 or ASCII character sets (used
to to encode the `.txt` file). The square on the lower right likely represents
lower case letters, with the other two squares showing capitals and
punctuation.

The second image (Fig. 12) shows the same novel encoded into the popular
Mobipocket (`.mobi`) book format, used to store books on an Amazon Kindle
device, for example. While the plain text signature is still present, other
structures now also come into view. These are not human-legible under closer
examination (using a hex-editor for example) because the data is encrypted. The
plain text characters remaining comprise snippets of code, and some light
header and footer information, identifying the file to reader applications.

To produce the third image (Fig. 13), I encode the plain text version of the
novel into the Portable Document Format (`.pdf`), another commonly circulated
binary format for document storage. In an additional step, I use code injection
techniques outlined in @rahman_getting_2010, @stevens_malicious_2011, and
@maiorca_looking_2013 to introduce a malicious script into the header of the
file. Depending on the version of the reader's Adobe Acrobat Reader, the code
will execute when opening the document, with the potential of causing
significant corruption to the system. The injection is clearly visible in the
image, manifesting as a "cavity" of un-encrypted characters. Steps
could be taken to further mask the malicious script, blending it with the
background encrypted bit structure (shown as speckled noise), which would make
the injection more difficult to detect.

In conclusion, I do not mean to imply that the "closest possible" reading of
this sort, at the circuit and magnetic storage level, will somehow come to
supplement reading at the surface for meaning and representation. Microanalysis
is meant to complement close reading: giving it proper scope in time and space
for its operation. But reading at the surface alone also risks losing sight of
the naked struggle for power and control at the device level. The machine *can*
determine the message when unchecked. In these conditions, reading without
depth may struggle to even locate its object of study, as surface
representations change dynamically, tailoring themselves to fit the reader's
mood, to match the environment, or to please some remote censor. Best, Marcus,
and Sontag are right in treating claims to symptomatic reading with suspicion,
as claims to power. The reader of depth divines secret knowledge, with or
without merit, creating an imbalance of interpretation. Critical reading in all
dimensions must therefore begin with the ethics of mutual legibility. It
succeeds when readers reclaim the underlying material conditions of their
meaning making. The very architects of the "smart" literary device tell us: the
answer to the machine remains in the machine.

[^ln2-illusion]: Matthew Kirschenbaum puts it this way: "Computers are unique
in the history of writing technologies in that they present a premeditated
material environment built and engineered to propagate an illusion of
immateriality; the digital nature of computational representation is precisely
what enables this illusion---or else call it a working model---of immaterial
behavior" [@kirschenbaum_mechanisms_2012, 135].

decade of the twenty-first century) commercially, much beyond the prototype
stage.

[^ln2-translate]: Translations are mine, unless cited otherwise.

[^ln2-barthes]: "The work is a fragment of substance," he writes. The work is
"moderately symbolic" where text is "radically symbolic." The work "occupies
space of books," where the text is "a process of demonstration," "experienced
only in an activity of production." He writes also that "the Text cannot stop
(for example, on a library shelf); its constitutive movement is that of cutting
across (in particular, it can cut across the work, several works)"
[@barthes_work_1978, 156-7].

[^ln2-descartes]: It is difficult to resist quoting from Descartes's
*Meditations on First Philosophy* when discussing idealism. He writes: "Let us
consider the things that people ordinarily think they understand best of all,
namely the bodies that we touch and see. I don't mean bodies in general---for
our general thoughts are apt to be confused---but one particular body: this
piece of wax, for example. It has just been taken from the honeycomb; it still
tastes of honey and has the scent of the flowers from which the honey was
gathered; its color, shape and size are plain to see; it is hard, cold and can
be handled easily; if you rap it with your knuckle it makes a sound. In short,
it has everything that seems to be needed for a body to be known perfectly
clearly. But as I speak these words I hold the wax near to the fire, and look!
The taste and smell vanish, the color changes, the shape is lost, the size
increases; the wax becomes liquid and hot; you can hardly touch it, and it no
longer makes a sound when you strike it. But is it still the same wax? Of
course it is; no one denies this. So what was it about the wax that I
understood so clearly? Evidently it was not any of the features that the senses
told me of; for all of them---brought to me through taste, smell, sight, touch
or hearing---have now altered, yet it is still the same wax."

[^ln2-marinetti]: "Il nostro amore crescente per la materia, la volontà di
penetrarla e di conoscere le sue vibrazioni, la simpatia fisica che ci lega ai
motori, ci spingono all'uso dell'onomatopea." [from Lo splendore geometrico a
meccanico e la sensibilità numerica]

[^ln2-echenbaum]: "Что касается 'формы', то формалистам было важно только
повернуть значение этого запутанного термина так, чтобы он не мешал постоянной
своей ассоциацией с понятием 'содержания', еще более запутанным и совершенно
ненаучным" [@echenbaum part3 of Teoria Formalnogo Metoda]

[^ln2-translate]: "In our discussion of this text we have been using an
authoritative French translation of Plato, the one published by Guillaume Bude.
In the case of *Phaedrus*, the translation is by Leon Robin. We will continue to
refer to it, inserting Greek text in parenthesis [@derrida_dissemination_1981,
71]."

[^ln2-gurevich]: Kittler mistakingly attributes "Algorithms in the World of
Bounded Resources" to Brosl Hasslacher. The author is rather Yuri Gurevich,
Principle Researcher at Microsoft Research and then a professor at the
University of Michigan. Hasslacher's essay entitled "Beyond the Turing Machine"
appeared in the same volume of collected essays, @herken_universal_1988.

[^ln2-bottom]: For example, in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of
communication, the top-most layer of protocols and interface method is called
the "application layer" and the bottom-most layer the "physical layer"
[@peterson_computer_2007, 26-28]. Timothy Colburn and Gary Shute describe it as
being "responsible for encoding bits onto a transmission medium, whether wires,
fiber optics, or radio broadcast, in ways that maximize the transmission rate
and minimize sensitivity to noise [@colburn_abstraction_2007, 181].

[^ln2-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
matter, what we regard as computer instructions, and consequently what we
regard as computer programs, is determined by computers available," he writes
[@moor_three_1978, 215]. Nurbay Irmark argues that software is instead a purely
abstract artifact, akin to a musical work [@irmak_software_2012]. See also
@turner_programming_2013; @colburn_software_1999.

[^ln2-turing]: The intellectual history of the Turing machine is well
established, in multiple works on the subject. It follows the Greek Diophantus,
René Descartes, Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell,
Kurt Gödel, Ludwig Wittgenstein [@petzold_annotated_2008;
@herken_universal_1988; @grattan-guinness_development_1981].

[^ln2-alt]: "We have to think (in a completely novel way) the relation between
a science and the ideology [...] the fact that such an investigation confronts
us with the observation that every science, in the relationship it has with
ideology it emerged from, can only be thought as a 'science of ideology, would
disconcert us, were we not forewarned of the name of the *object* of knowledge,
which can only exist in the form of ideology" [@althusser_reproduction_2014,
46].

[^ln2-derr]: See @derrida_writing_1978. I am alluding particularly to
statements like "ethnology-like any science-comes about within the element of
discourse," and "this moment was that in which language invaded the universal
problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything
became discourse-provided we can agree on this word-that is to say, when
everything became a system where the central signified, the original or
transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of
differences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and
the interplay of signification ad infinitum" (278-294).

[^ln2-flip]: There is a long-standing joke in Marxist literature that involves
flipping Hegel, who prioritized the transcendent spiritual over the physical
and material forms of life, over "back to his feet." See for example
@marx_marx-engels_1978: "The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making
a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common,
every-day thing, wood. But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is
changes into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feed on the
ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and
evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than
'table-turning' ever was" (320). See also @engels_ludwig_1941: "Thereby the
dialectic of the concept itself became merely the conscious reflex of the
dialectical motion of the real world and the dialectic of Hegel was placed upon
its head; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing before, and
placed on its feet again" (44).
