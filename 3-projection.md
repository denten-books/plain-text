# Chapter 3: Projection

`digital, medium, mode`

To grasp the peculiarity of the computed sign stretched between the sites of
archive and projection we will have to build a shared sense of vocabulary,
which includes terms both technical and literary critical. The following three
chapters trace the passage of the inscription through the computational
device, beginning with its apparent, outward shape on the screen. The screen
has this one major peculiarity: it refreshes itself multiple times per second.
Thus even those shapes that appear to stand still on the screen move in the
realm beyond the threshold of human perception. We are vaguely aware of this
movement: it is commonly visible when a screen appears on another screen, as
it does in documentary films that show someone in the process of typing at the
computer terminal or watching television. The difference in the flicker rates
between the projector showing the image and the projector "in the frame" is
what produces the characteristic horizontal interference pattern. The illusion
of motion is key to understanding the mechanics of cinema, but what does it
mean to perceive seemingly static words against the background of a
fundamentally dynamic medium? Instead of a static and immutable sign etched in
stone or on paper we observe the sign in motion. To refer to the "illusion" of
digital textuality is therefore to identify the dynamic property of
projection. To place text on the screen is to bring it closer to the moving
image. What happens to literature that takes place on cinema screen?

In this chapter, I bring archival material---blueprints, phenomenological
accounts, and debates in the philosophy of aesthetics---to bare on the
question of projection. The nature of "digital" experience, as I will argue,
depends on some notion of "natural" and "analog" mode of human perception. The
change of *medium* from paper to pixel entails a corresponding change in the
*mode* of perception. The projection "attunes" if you will the viewer to the
message.  By attunement I mean something analogous to what Marcel Mauss called
the "techniques of the body" [@mauss_techniques_2006, 78]: the way in which we
sit for example, the position of the hands, the head, or the movement of the
eyes. The mode *structures* experience. It answers the how of perception.

Initially, we must simply know how to perceive: to look, to smell, or to
listen. The modality tells us "the register" of the message. Where to look for
it and how to identify its signifying elements. In refined arts it goes
further to more strictly govern the techniques of the body: you must neither
speak nor cough during a classical recital, for example. One can look at but
not touch artwork in a museum. As these examples show, the modality of
communication ultimately demands corporal compliance. For this reason, the
change in modalities must always be perceived as a claim on the body. In this
lies the starkest difference between analog and digital media. The shift from
one to the other affects not the message but the mode of perception. It is as
if someone has asked you to read a book or to watch a film in a stranger's
armchair. It feels off in a way that is difficult to explain. The mode of
digital perception similarly contorts the body into new and unfamiliar shapes.
I begin then with popular intuitions about the digital. The "two terminators"
of the introductory section lead us to the technical particulates of
projection and finally to the discussion on the aesthetics of digital
perception.

## Digital Wake (My Two Terminators)

What does the digital look like? It looks blue for one---not just any kind of
blue, but a particularly cool shade of pure blue, which passes from dark to
white, to translucent with starburst-like overtones. An online image search
for the word "digital" produces many sharp, sterile visuals of that kind.
Abstract geometrical patterns predominate in the first dozen or so search
results: often forming curved, three-dimensional tunnels or lines that
resemble circuit boards. There are things too of course, cheap and expensive
consumer things like scanners, flash cards, circuit boards, and backup drives,
but most of all it is cameras---digital cameras, the very idea of which is
meant to stand in stark contrast to "traditional film photography." Few
marketplace objects exhibit such a strong sense of the opposition between the
digital and the analog as a consumer camera. These search pages also contain
the outdated clichÃ©s of yesterday's digital detritus: digital clocks, purple
lightning bolts, and the abstract chrome landscapes made widely available by
graphic editing software in the 1990s. There are numbers. The preferred
arrangement is in a torrential grid---the matrix---descending in the
background, behind a generic humanoid form, also translucent. Or better yet:
alphanumeric characters comprising a globe or a face. Ones and zeros are best
arranged as an unending string, which runs at a slight angle on the Z-axis and
beyond the frame, foregrounding whatever object that is meant to take on the
digital as a property: the digital wake.

When we constrict the image-search chronologically to the twenty-first
century, we see these cool-blue images give way to a more varied palette:
bright prime greens, yellows, and reds in retro-geometric pixelated shapes.
Pixels take the place of numbers here---not the small, invisible pixels of
contemporary computer screens, but the large and boxy pixels that by their
very visible boxiness flaunt the digital being of the image. Such an image
alludes to the time when pixels really did stand out as individual units---the
technology not being refined enough to produce the illusion of visual
continuity. This faux lo-fi aesthetic likely appeals to the romantic nostalgia
many feel for the early days of computing, and yet it also works as an
assertion of independence from that history. No longer shall the digital serve
to emulate reality, nor be judged merely by its degree of lifelike
verisimilitude. The blocky world of Markus Persson's *Minecraft* (2009) stands
in antithesis to the magical realism of Cyan's *Myst* (1995), the best-selling
graphic-adventure PC game of the twentieth century. Where the critics lauded
the latter for its moody and atmospheric photo-realistic environments, the
former embraces the playful, 8-bit, low-fidelity aesthetic of gaming consoles
from the 1980s. The pseudo-pixelated world of Minecraft encourages its
inhabitants to experiment with deconstruction, producing cuboid landscapes
that foreground discontinuity of form and surface.

The iconography of the digital works in the other direction too, by approaching
and challenging the perceived continuity of the analog world. Liquid-metal
*Photoshop* font effects are thus supplanted by hyperrealistic renderings of
fire, smoke, and water: fluid elements that are by their very nature difficult
to render digitally, especially in movement. Digital alchemy approaches the
boundaries of technological possibility, but absent the constraints of realism
it pushes past reality, past nature, and past mere fidelity to the natural
world. A real-world explosion caught on film looks cheap in comparison to its
cinematic "special-effects" simulacrum. A blazing corporate logo rendered
digitally would lose much of its appeal were it produced by literally lighting
a logograph on fire. The burning digital logograph does not just say "We are
hot" or "We are on fire" (that would be too naive)---it says that our fire is
better than fire, more vivid and more lifelike. The digital fire is the ideal,
Platonic image of fire: an image that all fires should emulate.

I am eliciting these digital commonplaces to get at the conflicting popular
intuitions about "the digital" as something at once discrete, angular, and
therefore reductive and deterministic, but also shiny, smooth, perfect, and
liquid in the way that threatens to drown out and to transcend (instead of
reducing or determining) everything susceptible to the patina of time,
everything having distinct shape and anatomy. Think here about the transition
between films *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2*, where the "bad" robot that
sets out to destroy humanity is cast at first in the guise of an animatronic
mechanism, but then as an amorphous puddle of mercury that makes the original
mechanical Arnold look like a friend and savior. The first terminates with
shotguns and tire irons, where the second morphs into human shapes and pours
itself inside, threatening life from within.

Although the quality of being digital plays a central role in the formation of
new compounds like "digital media," "digital humanities," or the "digital
divide," the very idea of what it means often contains entirely conflicting
qualities. For some, digitality stands in opposition to the notion of
naturally "analog" human experience. On this view, digital media reduce
"fuzzy" and indeterminate human experience to something binary, discrete, and
deterministic. For example, "languages are not codes," David Golumbia writes
in his influential monograph *The Cultural Logic of Computation*. Human
language practice therefore should not be reduced to a "single correct
interpretation" or "at the absolute limit, a determinate number of discrete
interpretations" [@golumbia_cultural_2009, 291]. "To submit a phenomenon to
computation," Golumbia writes, "is to striate otherwise-smooth details, analog
details" [@golumbia_cultural_2009, 159]. Following Deleuze, Golumbia conceives
of "striated space" in opposition to spaces smooth and analog like brains,
society, politics, language, and baseball [@@golumbia_cultural_2009, 231 &
343].

In his essay against digital humanities, Stephen Marche worries about the
digitization of human experience for the opposite reason. "Meaning is mushy,"
he writes:

> Meaning falls apart. Meaning is often ugly, stewed out of weakness and
> failure. It is as human as the body, full of crevices and prey to diseases.
> It requires courage and a certain comfort with impurity to live with.
> Retreat from the smoothness of technology is not an available option, even
> if it were desirable. The disbanding of the papers has already occurred, a
> splendid fluttering of the world's texts to the winds. We will have to
> gather them all together somehow. But the possibility of a complete,
> instantly accessible, professionally verified and explicated, free global
> library is more than just a dream. Through the perfection of our smooth
> machines, we will soon be able to read anything, anywhere, at any time.
>
>Insight remains handmade [@marche_literature_2012].

In other words, digital artifacts fall under suspicion for smoothing out not
for striating difference and thereby for betraying some essential, wonderfully
messy property of being human. Stanley Fish, another prominent critic of the
digital humanities, writes in a similar vein. The traditional humanities for
Fish exist within the "linear, temporal medium in the context of which
knowledge is discrete, partial and situated---knowledge at this time and this
place experienced by this limited being." By contrast, the digital humanities
imagine a "steady yet dynamic state where there is movement and change, but no
center, no beginning and end, just all middle." The digital vision is meant to
deliver us from linearity and from time itself, Fish argues
[@fish_digital_2012]. For Fish, the digital fails because it does not offer
*enough* difference:

> Delivered from linearity, from time-bound, sharply delineated meanings, from
> mortality, from death, everyone, no longer a one, will revel in and
> participate in the universal dance, a "mystical dance" of "mazes intricate,
> / Eccentric, intervolved, yet regular / Then most when most irregular they
> seem, / And in their motions harmony divine / So smooths her charming tones,
> that God's own ear / Listens delighted. (John Milton, "Paradise Lost," V,
> 620, 622-627)

Whether too discrete or too continuous, the critics agree on the danger of
digitization. Digital being takes place of determinism and mechanization in
the role of the age-old opponent to humanism. 

TRANSITION.

I submit another historical case study. Electrical engineers involved in the
development of the telegraph at the turn of the twentieth century fell into
two warring camps, in a conflict located precisely at the fault lines between
discrete and continuous representation.

Systems based on the neutral direct current design[^ln1-ndc] assumed current
flow for some elements of the encoding (like dashes) and absence of current
flow for others (like dots) [@welk_neutral_2000]. For this reason, it could be
said that although the Morse code family of alphabets amounts to a ternary
encoding system (using dots, dashes, and silences), under the conditions of
direct current it functions as a second-order binary encoding. Systems based on
the alternating current design converted Morse code (and other encoding
systems) into pulses of alternating positive and negative current, where
positive current could stand for "dashes" and negative for "dots." Where the
direct current designs preferred the use of non-sinusoidal, "square"
periodic waveforms to represent binary states, literature on alternating
current design often argued for the use of a sinusoidal signal, which could be
more easily modulated into a multitude of states beyond binary
[@crehore_practical_1900; @hausmann_telegraph_1915, 374]. Consequently,
alternating current designs tended towards the transmission of continuous
quantities like images and cursive handwriting. The very visual form of the
sinusoidal curve suggested a connection to natural, organic shapes, like
handwriting, in a visual analogy between text and signal.

The Pollak-Virag telegraph that Bernhard Siegert mentions in his seminal essay
on German media theory was one such device.[^ln1-virag] The original
Pollak-Virag machine, patented in 1900 (and filed in 1899), proposed to send
regular (ternary) Morse encoding by means of alternating current of two
different polarities and two different strengths, for a total of four types of
signals (see Figure 1).[^ln1-siegert] Other than the irregular signal shape and
the use of alternating current, the Pollak-Virag encoding differed little from
single-Morse systems. By 1901, however, the authors were issued an American
patent for the "Writing Telegraph," which builds on their previous design in an
interesting way. Rather than using a wave in four steps, the authors propose an
"automatic transmitter capable of sending current impulses over the line which
correspond to the direction and the size of a single letter element"
[@pollak_writing-telegraph_1901, 3]. In other words, they wanted to bend the
sinusoidal wave to correspond roughly to the shape of the letter (see Figure
2).

![Record obtained at the receiving station, illustration from "Means for
Rapidly Transmitting Telegrams," 1900
[@pollak_means_1900].](images/virag-wave.png)

On some level, then, the Pollak-Virag encoding constitutes a sort of an
unbroken, electrical alphabet. The electrical signal, in this case, makes for a
smoothly varying quality, intended to "trace in a substantially continuous
unbroken outline the written letters composing the matter transmitted"
[@pollak_writing-telegraph_1901, 1]. The perforated tape "driving" the signal
does, however, reduce notions of continuity into distinct perforations, which
break letters down into their individual constituents.

collection of Jim Linderman.](images/cyphon.jpg)

The metaphysics accompanying telegraph communication at the time display an
anxiety about the role of the human in this process, where notions of material
discreteness and continuity are extended from the underlying physical structure
of communication to implicate higher-order cultural (and even ethical)
categories. Arguing in opposition to the sine-wave camp, Donald Murray writes:

> Certainly if Smith wants to make Jones spin round like a dancing Dervish, the
best way might be for Smith to transmit sine waves [â¦] but in practice Smith
always wants to make Jones perform an excessively complicated and irregular
series of motions, and for this purpose it is essential to transmit similar
motions by introducing upper harmonics in a fragmentary, non-periodic, and very
irregular way [@murray_setting_1905, 559].

Being periodic (and therefore, repetitive), the continuous sine wave is too
regular to answer to the diverse needs of human culture. Dance, in Murray's
articulation, can also consist of a series of irregular, fragmentary, and
non-periodic movements, much better captured by the discrete undulation of the
square wave.[^ln1-dervish] Writing for the Swedenborg-inspired *Spiritual
Telegraph*, an anonymous author unfolds normative neoplatonic rhetoric in a
similar argument on the importance of discrete differentiation:

> Whenever two persons are brought into sympathetic relations, either by
> corporeal contact or through those refined media which pervade the Universe
> and serve as the airy vehicles of thought, they mutually feel the presence
> of each other, while the mind which is gifted with the greater degree of

> the passive or negative relation of a learner; otherwise he will be likely
> to resist, unconsciously, the infusion of foreign impressions and Divine
> ideas [@brittan_spiritual_1854, 169].

Following Swedenborg, the telegraph spiritualists conceive the discrete quality
of human experience as essential to the Christian hierarchy of the
universe.[^ln1-swedenborg] To deny step-wise ordering of "refined media"
pervading the universe is to close oneself off to the "transmission of
impressions," in a communication act (consisting of a "contact" and the
exchange of signifying "thought vehicles") between "source superior" and the
"receiver of instructions," placed in a binary and opposing relation
("negative" but without "resistance") to the idea of the divine. Continuity
mixes the sacred with the profane. For the spiritualist, a truly Christian
order must remain digital. To maintain otherwise would be Gnostic heresy
[@edwards_neglected_1990; @shaked_dualism_2005, 52-71].

Following Kant, it is common for contemporary cultural critics of computation
to associate the digital, discrete view of the universe with determinism and
its consequent threat to the idea of free will.[^ln1-golumbia] The telegraph
spiritualists instead associate determinism with continuity. Witness George
Dole writing in his Philosophy of Creation:

> Scientists have prosecuted research on the plane of continuous degrees of the
ultimates, and they have thereby failed to penetrate to interior things of
discrete degree. Consequently they derive life as not from the Lord, but from
nature, of which they have no other idea than that it is something mechanical
[@dole_philosophy_1906].

Neither camp can ground their claims in the material contexts of media
production (or in cognitive phenomenology). Nothing in the operation of the
Pollak-Virag telegraph gives us reason to posit either analog or digital
representation as somehow more or less essential to the human experience.
Instead, in reconstructing the long chain of transcoding and transmediation we
observe a hybrid system at once fluid and mixed with discrete meaning-carrying
entities, down to the level of underlying cognitive structure (of human
perception). Rapid phase shifts between discrete and continuous representation
in themselves constitute the instrumental purpose of the device.

It is tempting to think of the telegraph as a digital [*sic*] apparatus,
created to convert analog [*sic*] input into electric signal. Much technical
literature on the subject makes that simplification.[^ln1-tele] The innards of
the Pollak-Virag telegraph reveal a more complicated mechanism---one that involves
multiple shifts and transformations. On some level, language, already a
discrete and portable representation of mental states, which in themselves
stand in a complicated and fragmentary relationship to sensory phenomena,
undergoes a number of further material-phase transitions. In the writing
telegraph, this involves what I have been calling transmediation: from
notebook to paper tape, to the movement of an electromagnetic vibrator, to the
recording mirror galvanometer, into copper wire, to the receiving vibrator, and
into the machinations of the printing apparatus that once again produces ink
and alphabet. In changing material contexts, language also undergoes multiple
changes of encoding: here, from script to perforation, into vibration, to the
shape of the sinusoidal electrical impulse, and back out through a series of
transformations into script.

By "encoding," I mean a "controlled system of representation." Representation
in its unrestrained form (as in "pictorial representation") differs from
"encoding" in the size of its vocabulary. Painting and other forms of
uninhibited representational conventions are limitless in their expressive
possibility. The "language" of painting is infinite, in other words. Encoding,
by contrast, reduces the universe of possibilities to a limited set of salient
"codes," like the alphabet. These codes have a formal grammar and rules of
composition. Although the expressive potential of written language is
limitless, in some combinatorial sense of the word, language and other codes
can "break," that is, be reduced to nonsense, in a way that painting cannot. A
telegraph of the single-Morse type accepts alpha-numeric characters at first
and then translates them into a system of signals, expressed in time intervals
(between the synchronization tone and the activation of the key).

It becomes clear from the description of early telegraph encoding systems that
transcoding and transmediation relate to each other somehow. On one hand, all
changes between encoding systems necessitate material phase transition, if not
from one type of medium into another (from paper to magnetic storage, for
example), then from one specific material context into another (as when one
merely translates from French into English on the same piece of paper).
Transmediation, on the other hand, may or may not involve a change in encoding
formats, although it frequently does, as when language on paper is transformed
into the pulsations of the electrical signal in Morse code. In reading and
playing music, a musician furthermore transforms musical notation---a
controlled, paper-bound vocabulary---into sound representation, the movement of
molecules unlimited in its expressive potential.

Blueprints for the writing telegraph reveal a device that mixes discrete and
continuous modes of representation, through multiple acts of transcoding and
transmediation. Digitality, in that sense, is besides the point. The telegraph
is a device that pushes language, normally bound to air (as speech) and paper
(as a writing system), through water and metal. Even today, deep beneath the
sea surface, telegraph lines ferry messages from continent to continent. And at
each end of the telegraph cable is a transmediation device that makes media
transference possible. I use the word "media" here in the bluntest way
possible: as "material basis" or "substratum" for some observed, higher-order
phenomenon (in our case, communication).

As information was compressed and pushed through the wires, it underwent a
number of transformations. Donald Murray, the inventor of the Murray alphabet,
conceived of that transformation in terms of movement from space to time.
Unfolding something like the "metaphysics of telegraph signalling alphabets"
(his words), he describes spatial writing symbols that "appeal to the eye," and
temporal, "telephonic" signals that "appeal to the ear." Paradoxically, space
signals (like a signboard) occupy little space, but persist in time. "For
instance, a signboard may extend over 10 feet and 100 years," Murray writes.
Time signals are ephemeral by contrast: "a Morse signal in a wire may extend
over half a second and 500 miles" [@murray_setting_1905, 86].

[^ln1-siegert]: Siegert takes the Virag as an "apocryphal emblem" of a
"systematic logic in the dominant cultural technique," representative of the
"order of digital signals" [@siegert_cacography_2011, 41]. Although not
concerned with the history or philosophy of digital media explicitly, Siegert
suggests that the writing telegraph symbolizes the cleansing of "the noise of
all graphic form." His theory of cultural techniques instead creates "an
awareness for the plenitude of a world of as yet undistinguished things, that,
as an inexhaustible reservoir of possibilities, remain the basic point of
reference for every type of culture" [@siegert_cacography_2011, 35].

[^ln1-virag]: The Pollak-Virag device also proposed an "electromagnetic
vibrator" coupled to a recording "mirror-galvanometer." The authors further
specify for "the vibrator on the receiving instrument [to] vibrate in harmony
with these impulses, vibrating in one direction or the other, according to
their sign and to an extent depending on their intensity" [@pollak_means_1900].

[^ln1-dervish]: One could make more of the Dervish being used here as a
negative example, in an instance of colonial gaze. But Murray himself was an
empire outsider, born in the small, remote town of Invercargill, New Zealand (a
town that also happens to be one of the southern-most cities in world). "I am a
child of the Southern Cross," he writes in *Philosophy of Power*, "and I have
no preordained respect for geniuses born under the Northern constellations" [@murray_philosophy_1939, 51].

[^ln1-swedenborg]: See @swedenborg_treatise_1778, regarding the "gross error of
those who assert the materiality of the soul, affirming it to be homogeneous,
and continuous with the body; whereas it is heterogeneous, and discrete" (24).
Swedenborg gives the neoplatonic, monistic articulation of the matter to the
angels, in the "Angelic Idea of Creation," writing "The question was asked,
'Whence, then, is hell?' They said, 'From man's freedom, without which a man
would not be a man,' because man, from that freedom, broke the continuity in
himself; and this being broken, separation took place; and the continuity,
which was in him from creation, became like a chain, or a piece of linked
work, which falls to pieces when the hooks above are broken or torn out, and
then hangs down from small threads. Separation or rupture was brought about,
and is brought about, by the denial of God" [@swedenborg_apocalypse_1901, 290].

[^ln1-golumbia]: See @golumbia_cultural_2009: "Following a line of criticism
that extends at least as farm back as Kant [...] (loc. 63)." Paraphrasing
@deleuze_postscript_1992, Golumbia writes "To submit a phenomenon to computation is to striate
otherwise-smooth details, among details, to push upwards towards the sovereign,
to make only high-level control available to the user and then only those
aspects of control that are deemed appropriate to the sovereign (loc. 159)."
To get to the bottom of the contemporary unease with digitization,
we will first examine some of the material contexts that support the
propagation of digital media. We will then look at a few formal, theoretical
attempts to describe the particularity of digital representation.  Finally, we
will have the chance to examine the specifics by which digital media
necessitates a change in the "mode" of specifically digital apprehension.

## Motion Blur

Televisions sold at the turn of 2010 started shipping with a feature called
"Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation" (MCFI). The technology causes some
viewers to report what has been dubbed as the "soap opera effect": a condition
where even an expensively produced, big-budget film begins to look cheap and
unnatural. I am quite susceptible to this phenomenon: I can tell when MCFI is
in effect right away when watching something on someone else's television.
Everything in the dynamics of the shot looks somehow fake. The actors, even in
films that I've seen and love, appear to be acting. I no longer believe in
their characters as real people. I notice their makeup and their props and I
just know they are faking it. The sensation is akin to watching bad silent
cinema. The style of acting seems forced and over the top. One cannot imagine
people took *that* sort of thing seriously. The soap opera effect makes relics
of recent cinema.

The technology behind MCFI was developed in response to motion blur particular
to flat-panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs). LCDs work by passing light
through a liquid crystal medium, sandwiched between two polarized light filters
rotated at 90 degrees to each other. As light enters through one side, it
twists following the slightly curved molecular structure of the crystal,
allowing the beam to rotate and to pass through both filters. The structure
unwinds when it receives an electrical current, effectively blocking the light
from passing through the medium (into one, but not out of the other). By these
means, a series of small, pinhole-like pixels can be turned on and off to
create shapes, letters, and images on the screen.[^ln1-mishima]

[^ln1-mishima]: See @mishima_novel_2004.

Traditional film projectors advance from one frame to the next at a rate of 24
times each second to match the rate at which the film is captured by
traditional film cameras. The projector's light flickers two to three times per
frame to produce the effect of continuous motion, giving the projector a
"refresh rate" of 48â72 cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). Without this strobing
effect, under continuous light, the succession of frames moving past the light
would appear as a blurry streak of undifferentiated images. An image persists
in the human visual field for about 16 milliseconds after cessation of a
stimulus, giving humans the temporal resolution of around 60 images per second.
Consequently, an average person begins to reach the state of "critical flicker
fusion," where the strobe light becomes unnoticeable at refresh rates higher
than 60Hz. At the limits of flicker fusion, the image begins to persist through
the gaps between frames, creating the appearance of continuous motion
[@efron_conservation_1973; @coltheart_iconic_1980; @brannan_applications_1992].
An LCD screen mimics the action of the analog projector by refreshing the
screen at intervals between 60 and 120Hz.

To complicate matters, human vision is more sensitive to rapid motion at the
periphery of vision, in a mechanism likely evolved to provide swift response to
predator attack [@burr_temporal_1981; @didyk_perceptually-motivated_2010]. As
humans move closer to their screens (as when sitting in front of a computer
monitor), more of the image enters the field of peripheral vision, making the
viewer more sensitive to screen flicker. Furthermore, being closer to the
screen increases the angular velocity of any depicted moving object. When
viewed from afar, the movement of several inches on the screen corresponds to a
change in the sight angle of several degrees, and likely a few millimeters of
iris movement. When viewed up close, the same several inches on the screen
represent a much larger angle, forcing the iris to move further laterally.

The human visual system is particularly adapt at tracking smooth, horizontal
movement, cognitively anticipating the perceived trajectory of a moving object,
while stabilizing the retinal image and keeping it at the center of the fovea
in what is called "smooth pursuit" lateral eye movement
[@rottach_comparison_1996; @purves_types_2001;
@didyk_perceptually-motivated_2010]. The "sample and hold" nature of the LCD
display frustrates the cognitive assumption of smooth movement. The object's
anticipated location does not correspond to its actual trajectory on the
screen, which appears to the eye as motion blur. To complicate matters further,
the phase transitions of the liquid crystal medium are not instantaneous. The
individual pixel "fades" instead of vanishing at once, leaving a physical (and
not merely a perceptual) trail of not-quite transitioned pixels in the wake of
object movement [@kurita_moving_2001; @pan_lcd_2005]. The motion blur is
exacerbated when viewing traditional film shot at 24 frames per second, since
even at high display sampling rates, the moving object appears at discrete
stationary locations punctuated by gaps in on-screen movement.

To compensate for motion blur, LCD manufacturers introduced MCFI, by which the
television itself inserts extra computed frames in between the original stock
footage. The extra frames should, in theory, make the motion appear more
natural, filling in the missing gaps that confuse the brain. Unfortunately for
the viewer, the effectively higher sample rates carry a major, unintended side
effect. Most viewers associate sampling rates of 40Hz and above with daytime
soap operas, which were, for a time, shot on lower quality video equipment as
opposed to expensive film equipment in use by the big-budget film industry.
Film is expensive because film cameras work by fixing the image onto the medium
through a photochemical process. Like traditional film photography, raw footage
must be developed and processed properly before it can be used for editing,
playback, and distribution. Video and more modern, digital recorders, by
contrast, transform light into fluctuations of the magnetic field, storing the
results on magnetic tape. The transducer (tape head) reads and writes directly
from and to tape, making magnetic storage significantly more compact and less
expensive than film, as it does not require chemical processing for playback
[@edgerton_columbia_2009]. Crucially for our story, video recorders operate at
60 frames per second, a recording resolution that together with a distinctive
color profile and audio aberration signatures give rise to what viewers
perceive as that "cheap video" look. By inserting extra frames into the moving
image, modern televisions in effect alter the expensive, slow format to match
its faster, cheaper video equivalent. The net improvement in sampling degrades
the perceived quality of the original. (It would be interesting to try to
create the reverse effect by reducing the fidelity of a "cheap" soap opera
video feed to 24 frames per second.)

The soap opera effect suggests a few questions for the media scholar.

First, it challenges the easy equivalence between "digital" and "discrete"
properties of the medium so often evoked in the critical literature. Another
mechanism must be in play here, since, according to accepted intuition, film
(the more discrete format of representation) is the one that more closely
approaches the analog (continuous) nature of observed phenomenon. Despite being
the more fragmentary medium, film is seen as the more analog format than video.
Under closer examination, film, usually discussed in the context of analog
formats, appears to be (in some aspects, as we will see) more digital than
digital video, particularly if "digital" is taken to mean "discrete" and
"differentiated." This incongruity points to a confusion in the common terms.

Second, it seems that the very material properties involved in our
understanding of "digital" and "analog" formats are also implicated in
higher-level functions of aesthetic judgment. Perception of quality in a given
recorded performance drifts with the vagrancies of encoding. "Good acting"
inexplicably falls apart with the introduction of extra frames.

Finally, where one would expect "artificial" digital discreteness to stand in
opposition to a measure of "natural" analog continuity, a thick description of
innate human perceptual apparatus reveals a complex patchwork of fragmentary
cognitive mechanisms, already to an extent digital and discrete in their
operation. At some level of analysis, gaps in the encoding format relate to
gaps in human visual processing. Neither can be said to represent reality with
perfect fidelity. Instead, brains and cameras stitch landscapes together from
an unevenly sampled landscape of variegated visual topographies, achieving a
measure of arbitrary synchronicity between human and machine.

Conventional notions of digital being further conflate the discrete nature of
digital media with human debasement, following the logic by which the
perceived material impoverishment in one sphere leads to the implied spiritual
impoverishment in the other.  The sentiment is everywhere in the popular
press, having deep intellectual roots in the history of thinking about
technology.  Philosophers of technology from Heidegger to Kittler advance a
powerful "hermeneutics of suspicion" towards mechanization, digitization, and
the subsequent computability of human experience. To take that tradition
seriously is to direct hermeneutic suspicion to aspects of digital being that
have meaningful socio-political consequences.  If, as the case of motion blur
suggests, human experience is already and always "born digital," that is,
discrete and differentiated throughout, we must find ways of advancing
critique along theoretical distinctions that better capture the instrumental
reality of media practice. Nostalgia for "analog" oneness and continuity
should itself fall under the critical gaze, examined alongside media marketing
slogans advertising gapless playback and lossless file formats. Digitality, as
I will argue for the duration of the book, constitutes a part of the human
condition worthy of conservation. But, what I mean by "digital being" relates
to the practice of buying "digital cameras" or to promoting the "digital
humanities" in name only. To perceive what is at stake, we must do much more
to disambiguate the digital cognates: electronic, binary, and computational.

## We Have Always Been Digital

Weak transition.
Let us start with digital representation expressed more formally, as done in
computer science, aesthetics, and the philosophy of information.

The difference between discrete and continuous quantities defines the
conversation about digital media.[^ln1-maley] For example, in a popular book
about what a "well-informed person should know about computers," Brian
Kernighan writes about "analog" as something meant to convey "the idea of
values that change smoothly as something else changes" [@kernighan_d_2011,
526]. Much of the world is analog, Kernighan explains. A water tap, a pen, or
a car steering wheel are all examples of analog interfaces. For example, when
riding a bicycle, turning the handlebars one way results in a corresponding
motion of the machine. This motion is smooth. Compare that with the action of a
light switch. A properly functioning light switch takes on two discrete states
only: on or off. A range of pressure applied to the switch does not correspond
to any mechanical action of the lever. But once a certain threshold is reached,
the switch "flips" to change states. "Digital systems deal with discrete
values," Kernighan writes. The switch contains a limited number of state
possibilities (2), where the bicycle handlebars could be rotated in an infinite
number of minutely differing gradations.

The philosopher Nelson Goodman (responsible for bringing the digital
conversation into the realm of aesthetic theory in the analytic tradition)
makes a further distinction in maintaining that digital systems must be more
than merely "discontinuous," but also "differentiated throughout." By contrast,
analog systems are "dense" and "undifferentiated to the extreme"
[@goodman_languages_1968, 159-164]. Written language and music notation, by
this definition, are digital systems par excellence, having the property of
reducing the undifferentiated, analog input (human thought) into discrete
semantic units (text or musical notation).[^ln1-goodman] Following Goodman's
logic one can reasonably maintain that the art of painting, unlike music or
language, cannot be reduced to the production of discrete semantic units, and
would be more of an analog system under the proposed definitions. In this
light, the language of cubist painting, which reconstructs shape into its
modular atomic components, can be viewed as an attempt to move painting from an
analog to a digital art form. The digital image, reduced to pixels of uniform
shape and size, takes the logic of cubism to its conclusion.

An interesting corollary to the continuous property of analog systems is our
inability to duplicate their states exactly. I can approximate the pressure
someone else puts on their bicycle handlebars with some arbitrary measure of
precision that can never reach perfect reproducibility. This means also that
while more digital art forms like literature are, in some sense, perfectly
reproducible, analog forms, like painting, are not. Following a similar chain
of reasoning, the late great American philosopher John Haugeland amends
Goodman's foundational definitions of digital representation to include
"flawless copying and preservation." This property further has the effect of
freeing digital representation from its medium. A Rembrandt is bound to its
canvas in a way that Shakespeare's *Hamlet* is not. Digital systems are media
independent. *Hamlet* can be reproduced on paper or stone, in Morse code, or
bound in liquid crystal, and still be *Hamlet* in some natural understanding of
the work. To the definition of Goodman's digital systems, Haugeland therefore
adds the notion of "feasible procedures" that can lead to "positive and
reliable" processes for reading and writing digital tokens
[@haugeland_analog_1981, 213-225]. In the case of the soap opera effect, we may
think of film as something like an "irreproducible series of paintings" and of
video as "perfectly copyable magnetic facsimiles." (This would at least restore
film to the conventional understanding of analog formats.)

Writing more than a quarter of a century later, Matthew Katz offers two further
important addenda to the discussion between Goodman and Haugeland. First, Katz
maintains that Goodman's notions of discreteness and differentiation properly
affect the format and not the medium of representation. Second, he maintains
that the distinction between digital and analog formats could sometimes relate
to the person involved, and not on the medium itself.  To illustrate these two
amendments, Katz gives the example of an approximate measuring system that uses
a supply of marbles in a large beaker.  The unit of measurement could be
something like a "number of handfuls." Even though marbles are a perfectly
discrete medium, the system is analog because no convention is established to
reproduce a "handful" with any sense of precision. My two handfuls will be
different from another's. A corollary to the distinction between medium and
format, then, lies in the user's ability to perceive quantities.  The reader
(viewer, listener) matters. Were humans endowed with the magical ability to
perceive the exact number of water molecules in a beaker, previously analog
systems (like unmarked beakers) would in effect become digital (under the
expanded definition). Similarly, were all humans endowed with hands of a
definite size and volume, "handfuls" would also be counted as discrete and
therefore digital quantities. From similar thought experiments Katz concludes
that the physical, perceptual, and cognitive capabilities of the "user"
(reader, audience, perceiver) affect the ontological status of the system
[@katz_analog_2008].

The movement from medium to user radically destabilizes Goodman's original
insight. Where Goodman begins with defining digitality in terms of physical
properties (divisible, or indivisible, dense, or continuous), Katz ends with it
as format imposed on matter from without. Undifferentiated matter like cake is
only analog until someone cuts it into pieces. Furthermore, the ontological
status of cake changes depending on the person doing the cutting. The cake is
more digital, in a sense, for someone armed with a laser cutter and a
microscope.  Similarly, painting can be thought of as a perfectly digital art
if we consider it at the scale of art gallery as a series of discrete,
replaceable, and reproducible frames(!) of canvas.[^ln1-art] What does it mean
to digitize text then when text is already, by some definitions, a digital
format?

These conundrums reveal a problem in the very formulation of the question: What
*is* digital representation? Under examination, properties related to the
digital--analog distinction cease constituting an ontological category. Rather
than a state of being, they indicate a systematic imposition of structure. The
more appropriate question then is: What *makes* for digital representation?

From the instrumental point of view, to make something digital is to liberate
representation from its medium. To digitize means also to allow for "copying
and preservation," actions that, when taken outside of their philosophic
context acquire an immediate practical implication (for a librarian, for
example). That is not to say that digitization makes thought wholly ephemeral
or immaterial; rather, that it allows for the continual advancement and
transmediation of thought---the ability to change specific material contexts as
afforded by the very property of "media independence." Digitization, in that
sense, is a necessary prerequisite for culture (in the common sense of
"collective intellectual achievement"). Without digital portability, all
representation (art and knowledge) attaches itself irrecoverably to
untranslatable and irreproducible conditions of its material production.

The digital being of representation, initially seen as a property of the
medium, arises then as a political property regulating the very transmission of
thought. Text on paper or screen remains digital only in so far as the medium
is not fixed. Truly digital text can be copied and placed into other hands and
minds, feasibly and reliably. The possibility of these procedures is what
ultimately gives representation its digital form. A document restricted or
classified in any way loses some of the necessary preconditions for being
digital. This also means that technologies like "digital rights management"
(DRM), which work to fix representation into a specific medium, transform
digital content back into its media-dependent, irreproducible, and analog
forms. Another way to put it would be to say that on "protected" devices (like
proprietary e-book readers) the content is digital for some users and analog
for those without permissions to copy, share, and transform.

The word, already a discrete quantity, comes into digital being as form when
coupled loosely to its material contexts. Ontologically, text is by nature a
digital format: first because it represents discrete units of information about
the world, and second, because it allows for some measure of "flawless copying
and preservation." Copying and preservation constitute the logic compelling the
historical advancement of writing. But, also note that "flawless copying and
preservation" are in themselves contingent (not fully determined) properties of
writing. For example, imagine a world in which ideas forever "adhere" to their
brain-bound media.[^ln1-brain] Imagine also a society that positively prohibits the
transmediation of thought, on paper or between brain cells. Envision extreme
forms of thought control that restrict the very basics of speech and literacy,
prohibiting the manufacture of pens, paper, computers, photocopiers, voice
recorders, and word processors. Such prohibitions would amount to total
censorship. A radically analog society would also be wholly mute.

Understanding digitality as a format imposed onto matter, a format that
facilitates transmediation, recasts the history of computing as something other
than simple "mathesis," the idea that computation reduces the world into more
discrete, and therefore computable, elements. That idea would be true if the
computer was simply a glorified calculator. But computers are not just that: in
practice, they reveal themselves as self-amending machines for universal
transmediation (not limited to numbers)---machines that, depending on the
user's acuity and dispensation to perceive text (and all information, really)
as deep structure, separate readers into those for whom texts exist as fixed
analog given, and those for whom they function as truly digital media, capable
of transformation affecting further texts, people, and machines. To paraphrase
a post-structuralist insight, the process of digital interpretation is in
itself a type of creativity, forever advancing rather than apprehending the
lateral movement of thought.

[^ln1-brain]: At the physical level, the process of textual remediation begins
at the brain, as when thoughts are initially transcribed onto paper.

[^ln1-art]: "Replaceable" and "reproducible" as in the sense that an art
gallery perseveres through the continual loss and rearrangement of its
constituent art works.

[^ln1-maley]: See for example @maley_analog_2011: "The received view is that
analog representations vary smoothly, while digital representations vary in
stepwise manner. In other words, 'digital' is synonymous with 'discrete,' while
'analog' is synonymous with 'continuous.'" See also @kittler_there_1995,
"Confronted as they are with a continuous environment of weather, waves, and
wars, digital computers can cope with this real number-avalanche only by adding
element to element."

[^ln1-goodman]: Goodman differentiates between "syntactic" and "semantic"
density. Some notational systems like writing and the decimal system are,
according to Goodman, "syntactically differentiated but semantically dense."
The key distinction for him seems to be a "limit on the length of message," by
which I think he means something related to infinite divisibility. The decimal
system as a whole can continue to approach a quantity indefinitely, reaching an
arbitrary point of precision. The computer limits decimal precision to some
arbitrary "depth" of approximation, making it semantically discrete. I find
this part of the argument unconvincing.


### 2.5 What Is It Like to Be a Telegraph

I am tempted to believe, like others have before me, that I am on my way to
enacting something like "machine phenomenology" or "systems phenomenology" in a
system which encompasses people, texts, techniques, and technologies. In such
cases, astute readers often reach for Jakob von UexkÃ¼ll's *A Foray into the
Worlds of Animals and Humans*, to borrow from his notion of perceptual worlds
(umwelten).[^ln1-umwelten] In his forays, UexkÃ¼ll imagines a multitude of alien
ways of seeing the world, from that of a sea urchin to those of a pea weevil
and the ichneumon wasp. For UexkÃ¼ll, the task of the biologist is not to
encounter such living things as unfamiliar "machines" in the human world, but,
rather, to occupy the alien life form as another subject. The tick should not
be looked at as yet another machine, UexkÃ¼ll writes, but as an "operator"
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 44-53]. Consequent to this point of view is UexkÃ¼ll's
insistence on the subjectivity of perceptual experience. The tick carries with
it its own sense of time and space, which the biologist recovers through the
description of its perceptual apparatus (What can this organism perceive?) and
therefore by reconstructing its projected world view (What does a stimulus mean
for this organism?). In this way, the subject establishes what UexkÃ¼ll calls a
"circuit of meaning." The canopy of an oak tree, for example, acts in unison
with material properties of rain to capture and distribute liquid down to the
roots of the tree. Capturing and distributing liquid to the roots constitutes,
in that sense, the "meaning" of the oak--rain circuit. It is a peculiar notion
of "meaning" to be sure, but for UexkÃ¼ll it is enough to maintain that meaning
arises out of the subject's interaction with its environment. The subject and
object are brought into what UexkÃ¼ll calls harmony:

> If the flower were not bee-like
> If the bee were not flower-like
> The harmony would never succeed [@uexkull_foray_2010, 198].

Similarly, the pea and the pea weevil achieve harmony through "meaning
transfer" between the pea and the weevil larvae, which allows the larvae to
prepare an escape hatch through vegetative matter in advance of its pupation
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 161].

[^ln1-umwelten]: See for example @agamben_open_2003, 39-49; @hayles_print_2004,
16-17.

The literature of post-humanism privileges these moments of alien subjectivity
because they destabilize an anthropocentric view of the world. What gets lost
in the shifting of perspectives is the apparent contradiction at the very core
of what the writer Dorion Sagan (rightly) calls "Gaia sciences"
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 12], the idea ascendant in diverse fields from literary
studies to information theory and free-market economics, relegating meaning
creation from the level of the subject to the level of complex system.
Paradoxically, because UexkÃ¼ll's model of communication makes meaning available
only at the system level ("oak plus rain" or "bee plus flower"), it is never
available to the subject itself (bees or flowers). The quest for alien
semiotics leads only to, in UexkÃ¼ll's own words, "mute interaction"
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 148], meaningful only from some vantage point outside of
the system. The forest always "understands" more than the tree, the planet more
than the forest, and so on, in a regression that can only conclude with
whole-universe monism: the One.

In his essay on the subjective experience of bats, Thomas Nagel concludes that
there must be something about the experience of a bat *for* a bat
[@nagel_what_1974, 439] that is not fully accessible to human description. The
attempt to describe things in-themselves for-themselves, in that light, seems
like yet further human hubris. Accepting the meta-human "systems" view of
meaning formation would mean also to acknowledge the limits of the human to
comment on the proceedings---lest the organ speak for the organism. And to
encounter the bat (a dog, a tree, a machine) from the perspective of the human
is to respect and to retain a measure of the other's ineffable alienness. There
is a quiet humanism in Nagel's suggestion that we should confine our remarks to
objective phenomenology, not dependent on the self-deceiving acts of the
imagination [@nagel_what_1974, 449]. After all, one can never truly become a
bat or a tick.  We can only imagine what it is like to be a bat *for* a human.
"Certainly it appears unlikely," Nagel writes, "that we will get closer to the
real nature of human experience by leaving behind the particularity of our
human point of view and striving for a description in terms accessible to
beings that could not imagine what it was like to be us" [@nagel_what_1974,
444]. Nagel suggests: "Though presumably it would not capture
everything, its goal would be to describe, at least in part, the subjective
character of experiences in a form comprehensible to beings incapable of having
those experiences" [@nagel_what_1974, 449].

I do not know what a truly objective phenomenology would look like, but I would
like to think that it would lie, at least in part, in the underlying material
conditions of perceptual media. I am able to advance an equitable description
of the system from the only perspective available to me. These blueprints and
diagrams are all we have to understand the ways in which the system affects its
constituents. Paying attention to the details of the schematics is the only way
to "dig" ourselves into something like an alien phenomenology. As the
humanities move in search of the digital, I find that they need to regain a
sense of the human. No perspective is available otherwise from which to enact
analysis or critique. Once recovered, that Archimedean point of leverage can
serve as a starting point for the work of de-naturalizing comfortable (if
calcified) notions of the digital. It is in this de-familiarization (in a sense
used by Viktor Shklovsky and Svetlana Boym) of the human that I see UexkÃ¼ll's
contribution to the study of media phenomenology. The human disappears from
view not by some inevitable property of technological progress, but through
automation of experience. In refracting ourselves through the gaze of the
technological other we see the human world anew.

From this perspective, electricity---the "language" of wires---is not a media
format intended for human consumption. One could learn to understand telegraph
intercourse through electrocution, by applying the wire directly to the skin.
Direct brain--computer interfaces promise to do more or less exactly that and
are common enough today to be turned into a toy.[^ln1-mindflex] The early
efforts in this space implanted electrodes into the brain directly to capture
single-neuron activity, or relied on imprecise "noisy" electroencephalographic
(EEG) scalp activity. In 2004 a team of scientists developed a way of
controlling "a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately" using
electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain
[@leuthardt_braincomputer_2004; @miller_spectral_2007]. And in 2015, a
quadriplegic woman piloted an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter using her brain in a
simulation developed by the University of Pittsburgh's Human Engineering
Research Laboratories in collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) [@collinger_collaborative_2014; @prabhakar_how_2015].
Advances in brain--computer interfaces suggest also the not-all-too-distant
possibility of computer--brain interfaces (in a reversal of the direction),
completing the loop between human and machine. This may also imply the
possibility of communicating brain-states directly, without the mediation of
text or sound. However futuristic that possibility may seem to us today, it is
merely a small evolutionary step in a long history of brain-to-brain
interfaces, already mediated by paper, ink, code, and silicon. The digital
world of paper and ink holds no less magic.

I return, then, to the subject of time, found throughout in the background of
this chapter. The popular imagination of digital machines belies a deep sense
of anxiety about the rhythm of the system as a whole, in which humans play only
a small part (as bug operators, users, or receivers). Telegraphs and
subsequently computers force an atomization of experience into discrete bits,
along with the opposite movement toward continuity fluid and rapid enough as to
move beyond the boundaries of human perception. Attention to the material
conditions of removable storage media reveals a delicate negotiation of
synchronicity between human and machine time, in a complex chain of encoding
and re-mediation that connects differing and incongruent perceptual apparatus.
Under these conditions, it would be a mistake to conflate digital and discrete,
just as it would be a mistake to reduce the human to the continuous.[^ln1-cont]
Homeostasis is found at some arbitrary point, contingently connected to human
biology and to current technological capability. The question of "What
constitutes a moment?" when watching television or reading a book, can become
then, "What *should* constitute a moment?" For the tick lying in wait for its
next warm meal, a moment can last for decades (UexkÃ¼ll reports up to 18
years). "Time, which frames all events," UexkÃ¼ll writes, "seemed to us to be
the only objectively consistent factor [â¦], but now we see that the subject
controls the time of its environment" [@uexkull_foray_2010, 52]. The
computational environment before us constitutes the grounds for all
higher-level textual activity, from record keeping to poetry and software
development. From the textual grounds of human--machine interaction it then
becomes possible to derive poetics, in the sense of a study and an art of
creating one's own time: taking control of prosody, rhythm, meter, and cadence.

dragging perception along for the ride. In fact, it seems to work the other way
around: Rhythms in the environment, such as those in music or speech, can draw
neural oscillations into their tempo, effectively synchronizing the brain's
rhythms with those of the world around us" [@hickok_its_2015]. His study on the
topic is forthcoming in *Psychological Science* in 2015.

I happen to be a humanist among the physical scientists here at the National
Bureau of Standards. Begins with a quote from Marshall McLuhan. "He who does
his work like a machine, grows a heart like a machine in his breast, and he who
carries a heart of the machine in his breast losses his simplicity. He who has
lost his simplicity, becomes unsure of the strivings of his soul."

"It is a long way from standards like the alphabet to standards like privacy
with the respect to the use of computers."

"We are concerned not only with nuts and bolts and screw threads or with the
standards related to the phenomena of matter and materials. We are becoming
increasingly concerned about man and about how man becomes a part of this
measuring system" [2].

Heidegger would be good here.

## Multiplexing

In his 1949 paper on "The Genesis and Speed of Telegraph Codes," Frank Halstead
noted that "the practical upper limits of speed will also be limited by the
ability of some human beings to operate a keyboard, until such time as
electrical connection be made direct with the receiver's central nervous
system" [@halstead_genesis_1949, 451].

The Hughes telegraph, an 1855 design modification of an 1846 telegraph invented
by the American Royal E. House, was a capricious machine that relied on a
tuning mechanism to transmit individual characters. Inspired by the player
piano, the Hughes telegraph even looked like a piano, complete with a keyboard
and a rotating drum, commonly used in music boxes. The sending device struck a
tone which, when transmitted by electrical current, would initiate the rotation
of a similar drum in the receiving apparatus "at the pleasure of the distant
operator," in Hughes's words. The length of time between the initial
synchronization signal and the struck chord corresponded to a letter, which the
machine then printed to tape using a letter wheel. Hughes referred to the
device as a "Compound Magnetic and Vibrating Printing Instrument," a name that
hints at the fragility of the device. The message became impossible to decipher
should the sending drum and the receiving drum fall out of sync
[@hughes_improvement_1856; @hayles_print_2004, 145-147; @noll_evolution_2007,
20-21].

Emile Baudot was one of the first engineers to notice that the prevailing Morse
and Hughes telegraph systems failed to make full use of the time allotted for
message transmission. The Hughes code in particular made extensive use of long
silences, which could be condensed to extract more utility from the channel.
Baudot-type multiplexers made use of synchronized rotating mechanisms both of
the sending and the receiving end, to distribute units of time among multiple
operators. Figure 6 shows a scheme for a duplex printing telegraph, for
example. A single rotation of the synchronization device (known as the
"distributor") was thereby divided into two units of five segments each, each
corresponding to a distinct channel of communication. Two operators could
therefore share the same channel to transmit two different messages.

![Multiple Printing Telegraph, 1905
[@murray_setting_1905].](images/multiplex.png)

The maintaining of unison became of paramount importance in such multiplexed
systems. The operators of a time-shared device needed to know when it was their
turn to type. The Baudot multiplexer made use of a time- or cadence- "tapper"
mechanism to indicate turns to individual operators, and in some devices,
locking the keyboard to prevent out-of-turn input. In a quadruplex system up to
four operators would engage in an intricate dance of fingers, keys, tappers,
and signals, synchronized by the rotation of the telegraph distributor.

Synchronization was also needed for Morse code devices, to distinguish
non-meaning carrying silence (the receiver is turned off) from the
meaning-carrying one (the receiver pauses to indicate a dot). The receiving
device needed a measure (duration) of silence to differentiate between "dots"
and spaces between words, both indicated by silences of different length. But
if the devices went out of sync, or if communication lagged for some reason,
the coherence of the message faltered. Sending and receiving machines had to be
tuned to a cadence of common information exchange. The system of operators,
transmitters, and receivers, was, in aggregate, tuned to a specific but
arbitrary rhythm by which certain messages made sense only in particular (also
arbitrary) units of time. In early telegraphy, these units of time were slower
than natural human time, enough so for the operator to remain idle. Later
systems increased the pace to a rhythm beyond natural human abilities of
comprehension, to a point where human operators could no longer decipher the
signal without machine assistance. In the language of wiremen, the bugs were
"running away with" the whole "game" [@brackbill_telegraphers_1929, 288].

Several engineering solutions emerged to transcend the limits of human
information processing. The automated printing telegraph decoupled encoding
from transmission. It then became possible to prepare messages in advance, in
volume, and to run the messages through a machine without human assistance. At
that point, telegraph diverged from the telephone to become a device of
asynchronous communication, displacing the act of communication in time as it
did in space. But even with the advent of removable storage media, the
bandwidth, or the "information density," of the system was limited by the
number and the size of available cables. Independent developments in
communication technology led to a range of techniques known as
"multiplexing"---ways of sharing the same wire to send multiple messages.
Multiplexing at the time fell into two broad approaches: time-division and
pulse-amplitude modulation [@rowland_multiplex_1901; @hausmann_telegraph_1915].
Pulse-amplitude modulation involved filling the available space (bandwidth)
with simultaneous signals of different types: sending multiple signals at
differing frequencies that shared the same channel.[^ln1-multi] Pulse-amplitude
modulation was difficult to implement initially. Cross-channel noise and device
sensitivity hampered reliable reception and decoding across multiple
simultaneous wave frequencies.

Although the discovery of binary arithmetic rightly belongs to
Gottfried Leibniz, who, influenced by hexagrams in the *I Ching*, articulated
his own system in his *Explication de l'ArithmÃ©tique Binaire* (written in 1679
and published in 1703) [@leibnitz_explication_1703], Bacon should take the
credit for articulating a system for fixed-length binary encoding. The
fixed-length property of Bacon's cipher, later implemented in the 5-bit Baudot
code, signaled the beginning of the modern era of serial communications
[@jennings_annotated_2004]. Baudot and the related Murray alphabets
[^ln1-murray] were designed specifically with automation in mind. Both being
fixed-length alphabets, the Baudot in particular did away with the "end of
charachter" that separated letters in Morse. Fsignals could be divided
into letters by count (every five codes representing a single character).
Additionally, the Murray code was more compact than Morse and especially more
economical than Hughes, which used up to 54 measures of silence to send a
signal representing double quotes.[^ln1-zero] The signal for "zero" in Morse
code occupied 22 measures. By contrast, all Baudot and Murray characters were a
mere five units in length, with the maximum of ten used to switch the receiving
device into "figure" or "capital letter" states (for the total of ten units)
[@murray_setting_1905; @beauchamp_history_2001 380-397].

As the volume of transmissions increased, human operators were simply not fast
enough to keep up with the demand of encoding and decoding messages into and
from Morse code. The rise of printing telegraphs answered the demand of
increased information exchange. The great variety of printing telegraph designs
at the turn of the twentieth century all attempted to solve the problem of
automating the encoding and decoding mechanisms of transmission, with the goal
of speeding up and increasing the volume of possible communication.[^ln-cables]

Donald Murray, the entrepreneur and the inventor of the popular Murray
telegraph, writes: "It is the object of machine telegraphy not only to increase
the saving of telegraph wire [...] but also to reduce the labor cost of
translation and writing by the use of suitable machines" [@murray_setting_1905,
557]. Baudot's and Murray's codes were not only shorter, they were simpler and
less error-prone, resulting in less complicated and more durable devices. By
the end of the nineteenth century a number of devices were in use
internationally, making it possible to decouple the real-time encoding of text
into code from the operation of the machine. A tape containing the message
could be prepared in advance, fed into the telegraph, and printed in
human-legible form on the receiving end.


## Medium not the Message (attunement)

What matters is that the medium is largely independent from the type of
information stored on it, and this contrary to Marshall McLuhan infamous "the
medium is the message" dictum.15 The world itself "medium" is misleading in
this context. We could for example say that paint is the medium of painting.
But what about the photograph of a painting? Or its digital reproduction? The
situation is even more confusing when we begin thinking about music, for
example. What is the medium for J.S.  Bach's Double Violin Concerto: the
violin or the music sheet which contains the score? We are on yet more
precarious terrain when considering hybrid "media," like film or television
that are comprised of multiple sources and that use multiple modes of
transmission.  The confusion enters the conversation when we conflate the
modality of the information (e.g. music, image, text) with the physical
channel of its transmission (the medium proper). Modality may very well be the
message. Thus, it may be true that when one plays the violin, the music can be
said to express itself in musical terms. But not the violin! I could use a
violin to transmit a picture of an orchestra over a dial-up modem, for
example. This would only involve the question of how to encode the visual
information into a state transmittable by the violin (a primarily auditory
instrument).  The channel of communicationâthe medium properâis in fact,
information-agnostic. That is to say that it has no preference about the
message being transmitted (nor can it have a preference for anything at all,
formally speakingâpreference being a property we ascribe to objects that are
at least animate). We could therefore transmit a sonata by playing a violin,
as sheet-music, on a vinyl disk, recorded on tape, or by using an illegal
peer-to-peer network. In each case, the information transmitted remains more
or less the same, depending on the quality of your violin playing, the
fidelity of your speakers, or the compression ratio of your digital encoding.
It would be wrong too to consider any of these sources as somehow primal, with
others being something like "mere copies" of the original. We could for
example, start by composing music on paper. Alternatively, we could first play
a piece of music and then transcribe it into musical notation. In an extreme
but perfectly plausible case, we could compose by magnetizing a length of
ferrous tape first, and only then play the violin to reproduce what we have
"written." The medium does not know anything about the message. The way in
which we store, access, and retrieve the encoded information is determined by
the medium, however. We are the ones being shaped by the media. I do mean this
rather literally: the stage directions for Krapp's Last Tape would be very
different were Krapp writing a diary, or browsing his online social networking
profile, or if he were to embed a memory chip in his brain that was able to
store and retrieve the same messages from his thirty-nine year-old self as the
tape-recorder. The actor's body would move differently in each of these
casesâhis senses and his thought would be altered in many subtle ways,
depending on the channel of communication.

The separation between mode and medium allows us to retain a certain clarity of
vision in a rather muddled conversation about "media history." Modalities such
as visual arts, music or literature do not necessarily evolve, in the normative
sense of the word. Yes, it may be true that Filippo Brunelleschi invented the
optical linear perspective in 1425. But the normative evolution of art could
only make sense only against some concrete pragmatic goals, which the aesthetic
realm lacks by definition. Nothing is gained or lost when the fashion changes
from square-toed to pointy-toed shoes, and then back againâto use an example
that would surely please Mr. Krapp. Neither is "better" or "worse" for the
participants in that sphere of cultural activity. By contrast, the concept of
the medium does contain some sense of normative valuation, also by definition.
That is to say that the medium has a job, which is to facilitate the storage,
the transmission, and the retrieval of information. And there is such a thing
as doing this job better or more efficiently. More is always better in this
case: more storage, faster access, more reliable transmission. When the quality
of the information is not sacrificed, there are no instances were less would be
preferable by anyone with limited time and resources. For example, I would like
to be able to read or write faster. I value both of these activities, but my
time to perform them is limited by my lifespan. Assuming I could gain speed
without any degradation in clarity or comprehension, and barring any
psychological ill effects, the idea of more in this case must be a good onto
itself.

## Metaphor

Like the terminators of yesteryear, digital sprites and bogeymen lose their
hold over popular imagination. Digital photography, digital clocks, and
digital humanities already ring archaic in their futuristic ambition, going the
way of e- or i- anything: the way of retro-suffixes like -bot, -mat, -lux, and
-tron. The digital dissolves into the everyday as all clocks, all books, all
texts, and all human activity passes through some form of "digital being." My
aim here and throughout is to understand what is meant by its invocation: to
"come to terms," to make visible, to disturb it, to denature, and to make it
strange again.
