## 3.2 Co-authorship | Writers' Room
### 2.3.1 Writing together. 
Models of co-authorship (and why we should pay attention). The massively multi-authored online novel (Wu Ming and Lo zar non Ã¨ morto).

Auteur - genius romantic ideas of authorship. Lab life of writer's rooms. Tangibility. Distributed authorship.

I've been thinking quite a bit recently about the "costs" of collaboration, about writing (and researching) together, and about the tangled forests of drafts, manuscripts, and versions that sprout in the wake of co-authorship.

This brings me to a strange (but meaningful) space between textual criticism and version control
