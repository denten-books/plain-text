## Chapter 5: Bad Links (Problem of Copies, Action at Distance)
Key terms: internet, rhizome, web, network, infrastructure,

We often think of literary works as completed products. *To the Lighthouse,*
*Hamlet,* *Moby Dick* seem to circulate as complete, fixed entities. Textual
critics, in charge of creating a work out of a multiplicity of texts, remind us
that the work is a carefully-crafted illusion. The text multiplies, always
threatening to undermine the unity of the work. Think of something substantial
you have written recently: a paper or a proposal perhaps.

"Computer assisted tracing of text evolution"

Goodman's "Art and Authenticity." Benjamin. Immanence and transcendence.
Goodman: thinking about the perfect copy. But there is a confusion here: fake
art is not necessarily about a copy, it is about provenance. Autographic vs.
allographic art. Whether forgery is possible. Digital vs. analog art. Analog
art is medium bound. Digital abstracts from the material.

### 5.1 Copy Machine

Duplicates in Computer Science. Almost 30% of webpages are "very similar to
other pages" [@fetterly_evolution_2003].

It is a commonplace sentiment now that the printing press brought with it the
Protestant Reformation [@dittmar_information_2011, @febvre_coming_2010,
@mcluhan_gutenberg_1962, @eisenberg_word_1992]. Movable type is responsible for
at least a part of that story. The mechanization of print is what turned
writing from an autographic into a supremely allographic art. The Gutenberg
press helped place a copy of the bible into the hands of every ordinary
believer. That meant also minimizing the role of the priest as a privileged
interpreter. Without books in hand Martin Luther could not have written "all
who are in the church are priests" [@hillerbrand_protestant_2009]. Movable type
lifted text from rarefied media of parchment into that of the reified and
disposable leaflet. But until well into the middle of the 20th century, the
printing press remained in the realm of big technology: expensive, centralized,
unwieldy, and relatively easy to suppress. The liberatory potential of media
independence comes into its full fruition after the age of the typewriter.
After a historically brief flowering in the wild, our daily textual practice is
once again in danger of returning to controlled, media-bound, and
tightly-regulated conditions of existence.

Several important developments in the twentieth century aided in the liberation
of text from its material contexts. The first is the copy machine.  It is an
entirely unglamorous job to ponder the phenomenology of reading from the point
of view of a photocopier. Yet the impact of the humble Ditto and Xerox machines
has only recently began to get the scholarly attention it deserves. In the
United States, the copy machine placed a smaller version of Gutenberg press
into every office. And it allowed for the flourishing of a vibrant samizdat
(self-publishing) scene, usually connected to underground culture movements
without access to conventional publishing: punks, skinheads, computer- and
game- geeks, feminists, fans of science fiction and queer-core music
[@klanten_behind_2011, @piepmeier_girl_2009, @duncombe_notes_2008].

The word "xerox" firmly entered the English lexicon by the
mid-1960s[^ln11-xerox] along with stencil duplicators, mimeograph machines,
microfiche, spirit duplicators,[^ln11-spirit] hectographs, and dot-matrix
printing. A whole industry of photocopying still exists to seamlessly peel the
content away from one material medium and plaster it into another.

From the "point of view" of a photocopier, the text exists only as pure form.
The electro-photographic process at the basis of modern photocopying (invented
in the 1930s, but with patents dating back to the middle of the 19th century)
describes documents in terms of "electric charge patterns," "photoemissive
layers," and "sheet surfaces"  [@carlson_electron_1940,
@carlson_electrophotography_1942, @carlson_graphic_1953]. The photocopier is a
device for total graphesis and extreme surface reading.[^ln11-ooo]. There is no
word or content for the photocopier: only paper and image. The photocopier's
"job", if you will, is to lift a picture from one page and to impress it into
another. It does so by temporarily imaging text (as picture) onto a
photo-sensitive drum. Ink powder sticks to the electrically charged surfaces of
the drum in correspondence to the shapes on the page. The shapes are then
rolled onto a new page, re-inscribing the image into the new medium. The text
is never immaterial. But for a moment it finds shape as an invisible electric
charge. The transformation should not be reduced to some sort of mystical,
metaphysical moment. On the contrary, in instrumental terms we observe the
relatively mundane process of media independence.

Let's linger on that moment of remediation. The process of textual
transcription by hand involves a similar transformation. When a scribe copies a
page from the bible, for example, he also "lifts" content from paper.  Not
unlike a photocopier, the human stores text in the electro-chemical pathways of
the brain, before reproducing it once again into another medium. And like a
photocopier, the human can perform the copy function mechanically, without
comprehension and on a purely formal, visual level. In fact, the historical
record is full of errors that suggest that pre-modern scribes wrote at widely
varying levels of literacy [@goudsmit_illiterate_1974,
@bucking_training_2007].[^ln11-literacy] In the Muslim tradition, the prophet
Muhammad himself is sometimes called "the unlettered prophet," to emphasize
fidelity and lack of mediation in the transcription of the message
[@calder_ummi_1990, @gunther_muhammad_2002, 1-26]. In other words, the Qur'an
claim to authenticity relies on the prophet's ability to copy the message
"verbatim." On the conservative Muslim view, anything but a faithful
transcription of the original text amounts to an interpretation, not
self-identical to the letter of the text (a translation, for example)
[@tibawi_is_1962, @fatani_translation_2005, @wilson_first_2009].[^ln11-quran]

Where the photocopier placed a printing press into every office, the printer
placed one on every desk. Falling cost of print.

Finally, the text exists on the screen and magnetic media only, where the cost
of reproduction approaches zero.

### 5.2 Copy Text (textual criticism)

The division of text into form and content makes a difference in more
utilitarian ways as well. For example, imagine the challenge of compiling all
known commentaries on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, by hand or programmatically. The
problem of what edition to use as the "base" for such a project presents itself
immediately. In the words of Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine, the editors of
*Folger Digital Texts*, "readers assume that there is a single text for the
plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare's plays were not published the
way modern novels or plays are today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions,
represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by
his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example,
three very different versions of *Hamlet*, two of *King Lear*, *Henry V*,
*Romeo and Juliet*, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their
base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from
the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text" [@mowat_textual_2012]. In other words, where the readers expect to
encounter *Hamlet* as a single, unified idea, they instead encounter a
multiplicity of slightly diverging textual "witnesses." Errors in transcription
and editorial interventions accumulate. The proliferation of unlicensed copies,
translations, and imitations further adds to the complexity of the problem.

Editors of classical literature will often solve the problem of diverging
copies by designating one version as canonical, preserving the formal
characteristics of the given version down to individual line breaks, as is
often done with Platonic dialogs. It then becomes possible to collate
commentaries, connecting each to individual words and passages at their
canonical location. The problem remains in the abstract: which version to count
as canonical? The act of deciding on what constitutes an authoritative edition
can quickly become a contentious issue, particularly when the text in question
carries religious or political significance.

A whole field of textual criticism exists in the service of negotiating
"critical" editions which in some way preserve the struggle to reconstruct a
measure of authority. But what should count for being authoritative? A number
of logical possibilities find as many ardent adherents. For some, the act of
deriving the authoritative text lies in reconstructing authorial intent, using
the author's notes, for example, or from first-hand witness testimony. Others
place a premium on reconstructing and analyzing the writing process itself, in
what has been dubbed as "genetic criticism" [@deppman_genetic_2004, 1-36]. Yet
another approach will compare multiple editions of the same text to derive a
possible meta-text, preserving all extant variations. Yet others will simply
rely on their judgment to produce what they believe is a "true" text based on a
number of personal and eclectic considerations [@bowers_rationale_1950,
@bowers_shakespeares_1954, @mcgann_radiant_2004]. Such approaches to textual
criticism have at least this one thing in common: behind the fuzzy profusion of
textual material they perceive the outlines of a single, unified work. As G.
Thomas Tanselle (a prominent textual scholar) puts it, "one must be able to
distinguish the work itself from attempts to reproduce it."[^ln11-tanselle] For
a textual critic of his kind, all real-word variants and reproductions are
suspect because possibly corrupt in some way. Despite its careful attention to
the materiality of the text as artifact, textual criticism in this vein remains
a classically idealistic pursuit. The work exists as an ideal form in the realm
of the ideal.

[ln11-tanselle]:  "Whatever concept of authorship one subscribes to, the act of
reading or listening to receive a message from the past entails the effort to
discover, through the text (or texts) one is presented with, the work that lies
behind" [@tanselle_rationale_2010, 13-18.].

Restoration and Anti-restoration. Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (for) and
William Morris and John Ruskin (against). Also Teoria del restaruo by Brandi.

"To restore an edifice means neither to maintain it, nor to repair it, not to
rebuild it; it means to reestablish it in a finished state, which may in fact
never have actually existed at any given time." [@price_historical_1996, 314;
orig from @viollet-le-duc_foundations_1990, 195]

"It is for all these buildings, threfore, of all times and styles, that we
plead, and call upon those who hve to deal with them to put Protection in the
place of Restoration, to stave off decay by daily care, to prop a perilous wall
or mend a leaky roof by such means as are obvioiusly mant for support or
convering, and show no pretence of other art, and othrwise to resist all
tampering with either the favric or ornament of the buildings as it stands; if

But whose who make the change wrout in our day under the name of Restoration,

no guide but each his own individual whim to point out to them what i s

them to destroy something and to supply the gap by imagining what the earlier
builders should or might have done." Data munging. Irreversible changes.

Society as Set Forth Upon its Foundation," Builder 35 August 1877.

Ruskin lamp of memory.

"It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that
has every been great or beautiful in architecture [...] That spirit which is
given only by the hand and eye of the workman, never can be recalled. Another
spirit may be given by another time, an it is then a new building; but the
spirit of the dead workman cannot be summoned up, and commanded to direct other
hands, and other thoughts. And as for direct and simple copying, it is palpably
impossible. What copying can there be of surfaces that have been worn half an
inch down [@staniforth_historical_2013, 2]?"

"But it is said there may come a necessity for restoration! Granted. Look the
necessity full in the face and understand it on its own terms. It is a
necessity for destruction. Accept it as such, pull the building down, throw its
stones into neglected corners, make ballast of them, or mortar, if you will'
but do it honestly, and do not set up a Lie in its
place"[@staniforth_historical_2013, 3].

On the Restoration of The Circumcision by Signorelli. "At Volterra, over the
alter of a Company in the Church of S. Francesco, he painted in fresco the
Circumcision of Our Lord, which in considered beautiful to a marvel, although
the Infant, having been injured by damp, was restored by Sodoma and made much
less beautiful than before. And, in truth, it would be sometimes better to
leave works half spoilt, when they have been made by men of excellence, rather
than to have them retouched by inferior masters." 1550 Tim's Vermeer.

by which a paininting may be obscured, but by which it is usulaly also in some

Report from the Select Committee on the National Gallery, London 1853, vi-xi.

Colliveau set about [restoring]this picture with uncommon solenity, because it was his
own. He began with the most delicate pumice stone, and very soon got into the
walls of th building, but was astonished to find the apearance of bricks and
mortar still, although not guite soneat; he soon cleared away the wall on
discovering a room beyond, and pictures, furniture, &c. most beautiful.
Gracious powers! how was he agitated; forgetting totally the mischief he was
commiting, his elbow went like a fiddler's; every thing vanished.---However,
finding a bed, the curtains of which (a dark green) were drawn close, he went
to work upon it ver tenderly; presently a pot de chambre came  in sight!---His
whole souldwas absorbed; his face all one ghastly grin; his legs (like German
flutes) tottered under him. Not that great philosopher Guffin Ragba, was more
agitated while cutting the leather from off his bellow, to disover how wind was

he found a lady asleep, very beautiful, because very fat, and a Dutch woman.
Now this part I did not see, and I believe but very few besides himself; but
alas! hew was soon to be at the end of his discoveries. Having got a glimpse of
some gilding, he redoubled his efforts, when he found it was an inscription; it
was in Dutch, and nearly thus, as translated by Mr. Peter La Cave:---"Now
caitiff, meditate on th havoc though hast made throughout thy lie, and go thang
thyself. In this picture, wretch! though have destroyed, what to the end of the
world, can never be replaced." [@bomford_issues_2004, 44-45]. Originally from

Colous . London: Darton and Harvey, 1803, 5-14.

"The sculptor wastes away th rudo block til he has accomplished the desired
form. not so the painter. he builds up his forms from a blank surface, and
hides, as he rogresses all the preliminary layers upon which the etxternal
colours depend for durability and lustre. And hence, not on the meaning and
spririt of the work must be understood; the restorer must also be familiar with

We have now traveled from the pixel down to magnetic storage media and back
from the storage media to the screen. The passage opens up space between
visible content, media, and the imposed forms that govern any and all higher
notions of literary activity "floating" above this nominally "digital" layer.
Technology does not determine the literary space: it has only the potential to
hide implicit mechanisms of machine control, or, to offer possibilities for
transformation not otherwise available to other forms of textuality. Loosely
coupled to its material contexts, text can continue its relentless drive from
matter to idea and into other matters as long as its passage is not hampered by
regimes that prohibit further sharing, remixing, and transmediation. I say nothing
yet of the potential necessity of such regulation. Under certain conditions, in
the name of privacy, security, or property rights, it may become necessary to
flatten out and to treat text as more of an analog, media-bound modality of
communication, limited in its ability to move across minds and cultures. But,
it is also in our broadly human, civic interest to keep such mechanisms of
constraint visible to view, under continual scrutiny of critical, close, and
closest possible reading.

### 5.3 Authenticity (problem of copies)

It is quite odd, if you think about it, to believe that objects somehow retain
an aura or a trace of their history: "a handkerchief used by Princess Diana,"
or "the cigar box owned by President Kennedy." In some real sense, the
historical patina covering these objects is only imagined. President Kennedy's
fingerprints and the tears of Princess Diana have long disappeared from their
physical medium. Their trace cannot be reduced to "mere" physical
characteristics: that is, to actual scratches, stains, or molecules,
recoverable from the object. Rather, the object had to "be there" in some way,
acquiring a patina of authenticity. "Having been there" is what gives the
object value, sentimental or otherwise, in a condition that refuses formal
reduction to a set of merely material properties. The high price contemporary
society places on authentic artifacts is therefore a type of magical thinking.
Walter Benjamin's famous essay on the work of art in the age of mechanical
reproduction appears to both celebrate and lament the demise of such magic.
"The technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain
of tradition," wrote Benjamin. "By making many reproductions it substitutes a
plurality of copies for a unique existence. And in permitting the reproduction
to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it
reactivates the object reproduced. These two processes lead to a tremendous
shattering of tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and
renewal of mankind" [@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. And yet, for Benjamin, the
easy reproducibility of modern art forms like film and photography also
"emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual"
[@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. One could read Benjamin's famous essay as a
piece of technological nostalgia, or as an expose on the magic and superstition
latent in modernist art. Crisis or emancipation? Benjamin feels both, and in
doing so he captures the metaphysical anxiety of the modern age. We desire for
our Vermeers to stay special but also for a Vermeer to hang in every home,
peering back at us from a multitude of anonymous reproductions.

The modern world faces the challenge of authenticity, which we have only began
to assimilate: politically, economically, and philosophically. The ubiquitous
holographic certificate of authenticity on a luxury handbag or on a "Digital
Versatile Disk" (how antiquated the DVD sounds already!) is a cheap band-aid
hiding the immaterial nature of these artifacts. Fashion and software companies
are reluctant to talk publicly about piracy,[^ln11-counter] because the so
called "knock-offs" are essentially exact duplicates, often "leaked" from the
very same factories producing the original.

Note that it makes no sense to talk about "what was meant" by the designer of
the handbag, the way textual critic may talk about authorial intention. Nor
would it make sense to "correct" some perceived flaw in the painting by
Vermeer. The practice parallel to "textual criticism" in visual arts is
restoration. Although similar to textual criticism in its aims to recover some
notion of the original, crucially, the practice of art restoration takes place
without reproduction. Unlike a critical volume, which essentially reprints the
work in its reconstructed entirety, restoration happens at the site. All
"unauthorized" copies constitute a forgery that competes for attention with the
original. One could say that for painting and handbags "matter is synonymous
with meaning," but the sentiment strains at the limits of critical vocabulary
in the tradition that gives us only the binaries of form and content.

The context-dependence of an artifact is not even medium-specific, as
Goodman would suggest. Texts are more allographic than handbags and paintings,
but Vermeers and Louis Vuitton purses are also in some sense perfectly
reproducible, like texts. They are texts, and I do not mean it in some
post-structuralist notion of "everything is a text."[^ln11-derrida]

Technologies like 3D scanning and printing increasingly reduce physical objects
to their textual representation, as is the case with the stereo lithographic
document (STL) format that describes objects for 3D printing.  Here, for
example, I reproduce code that describes "a surface" of a functional gun (the
code made available online by *Defense Distributed*, a self-described civic
liberty activist group):

```
22=(
BOUNDED_SURFACE()
B_SPLINE_SURFACE(1,2,((#34104,#34105,#34106),(#34107,#34108,#34109)),
 .UNSPECIFIED.,.F.,.F.,.F.)
B_SPLINE_SURFACE_WITH_KNOTS((2,2),(3,3),(15.1641909236141,15.3257778193699),
(2.99329024107099,3.14159265358979),.UNSPECIFIED.)
GEOMETRIC_REPRESENTATION_ITEM()
RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_SURFACE(((1.,0.997252058758362,1.),(1.,0.997252058758362,
1.)))
REPRESENTATION_ITEM('')
SURFACE()
);
```

This piece of code exists in its Platonic ideal *before* the physical artifact.
As costs of reproduction approach zero, so does the line between an object and
its description. Imagine a world where to think "gun" is also to seamlessly
bring one into existence. The erosion of boundaries between object and idea has
a pronounced effect on the governance of goods, felt precisely at the
distinction between the autographic and the allographic. Governments currently
regulate the manufacture and the distribution of guns as artifacts, but how
does one regulate guns as texts and ideas? Any such effort amounts to
censorship. What was first regulated under the regime of property law, now
increasingly falls under the regimes of intellectual property and rights to
speech. Where does that leave the practice of textual criticism? In such a
world there can be no distinction between works and texts. Unlike millions of
reproduced Vermeers (which no doubt occupy this world in the form of postcards,
posters, and photographs), text is text. It lies before us in glorious
flatness, as thick as a sheet of paper.

Text as I have already began to define it Chapter One, is a digital mode of
representation, defined, at least in part, by a relative lack of "stickiness"
to its physical medium. Textual artifacts therefore exhibit the dualism between
text and work to a much greater extent than other forms of art and
communication. A Vermeer is always a work. Not so with *Hamlet*. "Hamlet" may
indicate a category of relate, or, an individual instance of a given work.
Philosophers Nelson Goodman and Catherine Elgin explain this peculiarity by
making the distinction between "works of art whose identity depends on their
history of production" and works whose identity does not. The former they call
"autographic" and the latter "allographic" [@goodman_reconceptions_1988, 65].
These terms will be useful for us throughout the book. Architecture and
painting, in this view, are strongly autographic disciplines. An exact copy of
a Vermeer or of a building by Frank Lloyd Wright could never rise to the status
of the original. The originals have what Walter Benjamin called an "aura or
authenticity." No amount of precision, down to the molecular level, could
substitute for the historical patina of the original artifact.

### 5.4 Problem of Drafts

Text as vector. Barthes: text as "an organism which grows by vital
expansion"[@barthes_work_1978, 161].  "The metaphor of the Text is that of the
*network*" [@barthes_work_1978, 161].

Internet is not rhyzomatic. Mediation is at stake. " But the bottom line is
that dumb-pipe email is unmediated, and therefore it's a business that Google
wants to get out of as soon as it can."

" It's also why I believe Google will kill Gmail as soon as it comes up with a
mediated alternative everyone loves. Of course, Google may offer an antiquated
"Gmail view" as a semi-obscure alternative to the default "Inbox"-like mediated
experience."

Problem of Drafts and Versions Documents as vectors. Not completed things.
Files as cognitive scaffolding for collective memory. Vissman.

Science lecture vs. humanities. Stuff that is known. Stuff that is not known

What does it really mean to "know" something? Or to have "read" a book? I have
had the following conversation countless times. Someone asks, "Have you read
Nabokov's *Pale Fire*," and I respond, "Yes I have." But there is a world of a
difference between reading it yesterday, last week, or ten years ago. The book
as an interface leaves an organic trace in the human mind---an imprint that
begins to fade as soon as it is created.

How much knowledge is there in the world? According to a recent paper published
in Science, 295 exabytes (or billion gigabytes).[@hilbert_info_2012;]

Whatever consciousness is, it is propelled forward on a thin edge of material
substratum. Reality exists only in the now, where the past is a memory and the
future only a possibility. Imagine whispering something to a friend. It does
not have to be very complicated, something like "I love you" or "I miss you."
The whisper dissipates as soon it is uttered. The percussion of the speaker's
breath creates temporary order: giving shape and pushing air molecules into
waves of pattern and form. That order begins dissipating as soon as it is
created. Within milliseconds, molecules return to their natural state of chaos.

To steel ourselves against entropy, we change the substratum from air to stone.
It's molecules are more stable. Etched in stone will be the same message. It
will last longer now. But it will also take longer to create. You will have to
carry around your tablet and chisel. The message etched in stone will outlive
the whisper and indeed will

It contains no moving images, no pictures, to sound, and no code. It is a
static site, that is to say it is compiled once, on the authors box and not
generated dynamically, in response to a individual reader's visit. *gwern* is
static, showing its visitor "pre-printed" pamphlet-like pages. But prints and
pamphlets betray a vocabulary of paper, whereas *gwern* is "pixel dust" (to
misquote @drucker_pixel_2014).^[LN2] What is it, if it is not a blog?

Just to make sure *gwern* did not disappear, I took a "snapshot" on January
24th, 2014 using Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The Wayback Machine, is a
mechanism to caputure a fixed version of the document. Unilike paper, text on
the web is never fixed. In fact, thinking of published documents (books,
newspapers, and journals) as a type of a "screenshot" helps understand the the
semantic slide between "paper" and "pixel." The medium does not matter (and
certainly not the message). In the few seconds that I am fixing the pixels into
a canonical version of the text, the author/s of *gwern* may have advanced the
same text conceptually, creating a new and diverging "branch" of the entity at
hand. That is why we must write "date accessed" in the bibliography. The
footnote traditionally points to material in the real world. The pixel is
virtual. The two differ in the state of being. One is emergent, and the other,
actualized. It is likely that the page has always acted this way: to serve as a
momentary textual glimpse into the eternal world of thought. The difference
lies in an evolving organism and its ossified imprint.

Internet archive. "Saved 152 times between May 5, 2011 and January 26, 2014."
That means that the page became static print 152 times. In all other

sense human lives are infinite in comparison to pages.]

never go anywhere. Just his posts on

updated.) ### Hypertext Ted Nelson.  Rise of intertextuality. The promise of
hypertext. Bush w/ Memex. Nelson. Failure of intertext. Borrow from bad links
here.  It is my intention here to convince you that links are bad. They are bad
when it comes to writing for the web in general, bad for books, bad for
long-form journalism, and even worse in academic publication. It is not that I
am against the idea of links. As we will see here, the problem lies in the way
links are used. That is also to say that we can do something about using links
better. But first, why are links so bad?

To start with, links are opaque. The worst of lot are links like this and this.
Of the two “thises,” the first leads us to Google and the second to Bing. But
your readers would not know that just by looking at the text. The best they can
do is “hover” over the word with their mouse cursor, relying on the browser
interface to show them where the link is going. And once they get there, there
are no easy ways to get back. The writer must have faith in the browser to “do
the right thing” in guiding the reader through an intertextual maze. And that
is not right when it comes to writing. In most situations, the author should
architect that experience explicitly. If you think about it, the old-fashioned
apparatus of quoting an external text is itself a type of linking. But rather
than quoting the whole text, the author only quotes the relevant bits. Sending
readers away to do that work on their own is lazy and irresponsible. Imagine a
tour guide who tells his tourists to “just go over there and look at some
stuff,” and “come back when you’re done.” Links can be that disorienting.

Links disrupt the reading experience, and that is the second reason for why
links are bad. It is possible that you want the reader’s experience to be
disrupted. But in many cases you don’t. And the reader is already distracted by
the proliferation of parallel windows and devices that augment their reading in
some way. Do we need to make that distraction easier? Should I link the
Wikipedia article on media multitasking or is it enough for my purposes to
simply mention Wikipedia, or to trust my reader to look something up later, in
a reference source of their own choosing? Or better yet, should I help the
reader along by summarizing the findings? It mentions that most folks already
read with a second screen in tow. It is not that unusual to see someone look
something up on their phone or tablet while reading a newspaper or an e-book.
Why? Because they don’t want to leave the flow of the first screen. There is
great pleasure in immersive, uninterrupted reading.

Besides being disruptive, links are ugly. They are ugly together, as in when
many links conspire to produce a tangled mess. And they are also ugly when
naked on their own, like this:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaGiFBG_WSEGKFey9sR0pafjjKK7Fuc0jhF5d4K1ouA/edit.
That string of characters is not meant for human consumption! The period at the
end kills me entirely. Meaningless punctuation inside of links coupled with
regular punctuation ruins the sentence and the paragraph. Of course, I could
just tell you to read something on Google Docs. That looks much better, but
then we are making the opaqueness problem worse by hiding the address behind
words that may or may not be related to the destination. It seems that we are
stuck compromising on either transparency, reading flow, or visual impact.

Links aren’t very secure to begin with, but hiding links behind words further
compromises security. You’ve probably heard of link-baiting: the purposefully
malicious attempts to trick a reader into revealing personal information when
following a link that masquerades as a legitimate destination. You can visit my
site to learn more about link-baiting. You shouldn’t have clicked that! (Don’t
worry, that was the real Google login page.) But even if one means well,
viruses and browser exploits can inject bad links into your otherwise
legitimate ones. A common technique is to install a browser script along with
some seemingly useful “search bar” that will redirect all legitimate links to a
site that makes money by advertising. Worse yet, you could end up on a site
that attempts to further compromise your computer. Links are not secure because
in linking, we outsource the relationship between reader and content to the
browser.

Links are opaque, disruptive, ugly, unsafe, and they rot. Links don’t last
because the content at the address is dynamic. It is not guaranteed to be there
decades, months, minutes after your initial visit. In that case, why even
bother? The link works best for ephemeral output (like a tweet). We must think
of something much more robust for any “serious” writing that hopes to survive
to the end of the week. And for the really good stuff, the kind of stuff that
is the purview of librarians, we need to cultivate sustainable, long-lasting,
responsible practices of online citation. It should work as well, if not
better, than the familiar bibliographic citation in print. This practice should
combat digital decay, not aid it. We need to think about the ways our links can
be accessed, mined, and preserved with the archive-grade zeal of the rare book
librarian.

Finally, links are terrible for accessibility. It is bad enough that clicking
on a small word like this is difficult for people with any sort of fine-motor
control problems. Being a little older in itself can make the online reading
experience painful. Things are much worse for those with Parkinson’s or for the
blind. Sina Bahram, a blind usability expert (who is himself blind) reports
that some sites contain thousands (!) of links in advance of actual content.
Screen readers for the blind must read each one of them out loud. For the
screen reader, there is no difference between garbage links and useful content.
If you thought looking at links is disruptive, imagine listening to a robotic
voice that pronounces every slash and every useless number in:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92pM6hJG6Wo. And that is why Sina Bahram listens
to his reader at 950 words per minute.

Any one of these issues alone should give us pause. Together, they are a cause
of grave concern. How did we get here? And what can we do to make links good
again?

How did we get here is not an easy question. A part of the story is surely the
excitement we once felt about hypertext. Links were supposed to break the
hegemony of linear narrative, ushering in a new interconnected world. To some
extent the dream came true. But links also brought with them such things as
Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Google’s PageRank algorithm tracks, among
other things, the number of incoming and outgoing links. This bias for
connectivity encourages “link farms”: sites that attempt to game the system by
aggregating links or cross-linking their own content. A sure sign of a vacuous
SEO-driven piece of writing is a certain cynical and strategic use of links to
other popular sources. How long until the SEO logic infects poetry, fiction, or
investigative journalism?

What can we do to make links better? There are a few things we all can do now.
First, let’s use links sparingly. Think smartly about whether you need to link
or whether you can make do with a good, old-fashioned quote or citation.  Don’t
link just because you can. Second, link explicitly: Youtube.com is better than
this. Third, realize that online content is dynamic. It makes no sense to link
a dynamic resource when the intent is to create a link to a static version of a
document. Tools like the Save Page Now service, hosted by the Internet Archive,
do just that. You can find this essay at
http://sprintbeyondthebook.com/2014/02/bad-links/ but its earlier draft is best
captured in a snapshot here:

Finally, do not neglect the humble footnote. Footnotes provide a nice blend
between usability, transparency, and good knowledge design.
