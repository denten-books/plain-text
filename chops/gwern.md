I can on only refer to you to an archived copy of *gwern*,^[LN1] and not *gwern* itself. I hesitate to call it a website, because it is a site so hostile to the web. "So I did not wish to write a blog," the eponymous Gwern writes: 

>  [...] most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise. They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are [quickly](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126034548/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/fashion/07blogs.html?_r=1&) [abandoned](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126035203/http://www.caslon.com.au/weblogprofile1.htm) - and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a terrible [ROI](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126035340/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return) for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something: they are rough drafts - works in progress.[^18] So I did not wish to write a blog. 

It contains no moving images, no pictures, to sound, and no code. It is a static site, that is to say it is compiled once, on the authors box and not generated dynamically, in response to a individual reader's visit. *gwern* is static, showing its visitor "pre-printed" pamphlet-like pages. But prints and pamphlets betray a vocabulary of paper, whereas *gwern* is "pixel dust" (to misquote @Drucker).^[LN2] What is it, if it is not a blog?

Just to make sure *gwern* did not disappear, I took a "snapshot" on January 24th, 2014 using Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The Wayback Machine, is a mechanism to caputure a fixed version of the document. Unilike paper, text on the web is never fixed. In fact, thinking of published documents (books, newspapers, and journals) as a type of a "screenshot" helps understand the the semantic slide between "paper" and "pixel." The medium does not matter (and certainly not the message). In the few seconds that I am fixing the pixels into a canonical version of the text, the author/s of *gwern* may have advanced the same text conceptually, creating a new and diverging "branch" of the entity at hand. That is why we must write "date accessed" in the bibliography. The footnote traditionally points to material in the real world. The pixel is virtual. The two differ in the state of being. One is emergent, and the other, actualized. It is likely that the page has always acted this way: to serve as a momentary textual glimpse into the eternal world of thought. The difference lies in an evolving organism and its ossified imprint.

Internet archive. "Saved 152 times between May 5, 2011 and January 26, 2014." That means that the page became static print 152 times. In all other actualitites, it remained evolving and potentually infinite.^[Infinite in the sense human lives are infinite in comparison to pages.]

[18]: Examples of such blogs:

    1. [Eliezer Yudkowsky’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20140126040858/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky) contributions to [LessWrong](https://web.archive.org/web/20140126041017/http://lesswrong.com/) were the rough draft of a philosophy book (or two)
    2. John Robb’s [Global Guerrillas](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126041136/http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/) lead to his [Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of Globalization](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126041301/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471780790/?tag=gwernnet-20)
    3. [Kevin Kelly’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126041441/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly) [Technium](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126041640/http://kk.org/thetechnium/) was turned into [What Technology Wants](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126042029/http://www.amazon.com/What-Technology-Wants-Kevin-Kelly/dp/0670022152/?tag=gwernnet-20).

An example of how not to do it would be [Robin Hanson‘s](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126042143/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson) [Overcoming Bias](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126042246/http://www.overcomingbias.com/) blog; it is stuffed with fascinating citations & sketches of ideas, but they never go anywhere. Just his posts on [medicine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115012232/http://www.overcomingbias.com/) would make a fascinating essay or just list - but he has never made one. ([“Showing That You Care: The Evolution of Health Altruism”](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126042648/http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf) would be a natural home for many of his posts’ contents, but will never be updated.)
