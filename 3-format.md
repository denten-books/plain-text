# Chapter 3: Form, Formula, Format

Text shapes the human body in strange ways. After a lifetime of reading
shoulders acquire a stooped countenance, as if the book was exerting pressure
against the solar plexus. Eyesight deteriorates through continual exertion.
Tendons and other supporting structures in the wrist swell from the repetitive
stress of striking keys, working against the resistance of the mechanical
letter. The word takes its toll. A further profound change happens when we
read and write along with the machine. As we interpret it, it interprets us.
Machine learning algorithms track the speed by which readers advance from
paragraph to paragraph, creating a "fingerprint" that points to markers of
gender, age, race, ethnicity, and economic status. Algorithmic agents follow
the movement of the eye and finger to direct the reader's attention and to
understand how the human brain makes connections between topics. Heat maps are
drawn to represent the dynamics of boredom, fatigue, focus, and desire.
Supervised training algorithms use our collective philological
output---sorting and commenting---to learn how to classify information
autonomously and to curate content that better suits our predilections. Deep
neural networks mimic the brain to build models of human behavior. These
models are notoriously difficult to interpret, as they are not themselves
meant for human comprehension [@andrews_survey_1995; @karim_x-trepan:_2015]. A
vast archive of texts written by machines and for machines supports the tiny
by comparison corpus of human-compatible literature.

Despite its formative impact on the practices of comprehension, code---the
programmatic sign---does not often figure in our theories of meaning making.
Instead, we erroneously consign it to the ornamental "formatting" layer of
document structure. We do so at our peril. More intrusive than passive
decorative elements like fleurons, daggers, and pilcrows, the programmatic
sign actively molds text to context. At the maximally blunt limit of its
capabilities, format governs access. For example, a command can selectively
render some words and sentences visible on the screen while suppressing
others. The ability to hide text from view completely or to make it so small
as to be illegible affects not just the style but the politics of text. Code
determines its audience, privileging certain voices and modes of reading over
others. It is in the sense of audience selection that the programmatic sign
acquires its non-representational, tactical character. Stripped of references,
resemblances, and designations the programmatic sign commands and
controls.[^ln3-bdrld]

[^ln3-bdrld]: Recall @baudrillard_simulacra_1994, 139-40.

Unlike figurative description, machine control languages function in the
imperative. They do not stand for action---they are action. More binding than
what J.L. Austin has called "speech acts"---edicts like "I pronounce you
husband and wife" and commitments like "I do"---control codes ensure
regulation. Code in that sense is an exercise of power, not its
representation. The difference between representation and control is one of
brute force. It lies in the distinction between a restraining order and
physical restraint. A restraining order *signifies* the calling forth of
codified power. Physical restraints like handcuffs *enact* the exercise of
codified power. Like all violence they do not stand for anything. The
handcuffs simply contort the body into the shape of submission. Absent a body,
the restraints draw an empty shape. Code acts similarly to shape the word.
Located somewhere between the screen and the storage medium, formats relate
matter to content. They are techniques by which immanent inscription, the
electromagnetic charge, is transformed into transcendent digital objects:
novels, songs, films, or poems. Formatting imposes structure.

Think of a paragraph, for example. By convention, writers use paragraphs to
break up the flow of monolithic thought on a page. The paragraph contains
information. Can one imagine an empty paragraph? Could the shape of a
paragraph persist outside of the material confines of a page or screen? Can
one imagine paragraphs that unfold spatially not in two dimensions, but in
one, along a straight line?  What about a structure of words and sentences
that extends into the third dimension: a paragraph in the shape of a cube,
instead of a rectangle? These questions boggle the mind because paragraphs
draw a singular figure. They are a textual container of a type. Any other
shape less or more than the paragraph would go by another name; it would
constitute another format. To imagine something like a one-dimensional
paragraph is akin to imagining a flat shoebox. A flat shoebox would no longer
hold shoes. It could contain only the images of footwear. A paragraph
identifies a similarly singular arrangement of elements. It is a container or
a data structure of a kind, made to hold a certain amount of words and
sentences. We may liken paragraphs, words, and sentences to nesting dolls:
data structures that contain within them further, smaller arrangements of
information: a word fits inside of a sentence, the sentence within a
paragraph, the paragraph within a chapter, the chapter within a book, the book
within an archive, and so on.

One could say, what of such arrangements? Who cares about the shape of
paragraphs? They are merely one type of a container among many. They perform
only the instrumental function to help get the point across. The meat of
interpretation lies in the content within. Words can also be packaged
otherwise. The outer container is disposable and therefore insignificant.

Formats could only seem insignificant in the past when they were few, simple,
and remaining relatively consistent across media. The book or the broadsheet
newspaper are known entities: we understand how they are made and how to
unfold them in space. Computational formats change rapidly and proliferate.
They contain further, as yet unexplored structural possibilities: shapes like
the paragraph on paper, but native to new media. What you saw is what you got
on the page. On the screen, what you see is but a small part of what you could
get. We are presented with *thick content*, beyond the visible image, the
composite of all the stuff that is contained within the three-dimensional
page. In print, content can be gleaned from the surface; there is nothing but
surface on a page. The screen is a laminate. Light and liquid crystal---the
preferred media for contemporary text---surge between the substrates in
response to electrical signal. Screen surfaces conceal further strata of
codification, inscribed onto recondite planes of inscription: hard disks,
solid state drives, platters, drums, memory sticks, layers of copper and
oxide.

A byte, made up of eight binary bits, holds a letter. The string of letters
spelling out "hello world" occupies eleven bytes on the hard drive: ten bytes
for the letters and one byte for the space character. A file in the Portable
Document Format (PDF) containing the same "hello world" takes up 24,335 bytes
on my system. What is the nature of the information added to text?
Historically, such data included machine instructions for the viewing and
printing of text along with cypher codes used for clandestine communication.
The PDF specification describes features that include "accessibility of
content to those with disabilities," "digital signatures to certify
authenticity," "electronic forms to gather data," "preservation of document
fidelity independent of the device, platform, and software," and "security and
permission to allow the creator to retain control of the document and
associated rights" [@iso_portable_2008, vii].

These capabilities mediate between visible image and stored information: one
surface facing the human, the other, the machine. The formatting layer
specifies the *affordances* of electronic text. More than passive conduits of
meaning, electronic texts thus carry within them rules for engagement between
authors, readers, and devices. In our example, the Portable Document Format
encodes among other things ideas about "reading," "authenticity," "fidelity,"
"preservation," and "authorship." Whatever literary-theoretical framework the
reader brings to the process of interpretation must therefore meet the
affordances encoded into the electronic text itself. Such an encounter happens
not on the level of representation or ideology, but on the level of the
physical, the phatic, and the imperative, where formatting and control codes
reside. Thick content accounts for the disparity between plain text and fancy
text, the latter defined as "text representation consisting of plain text plus
added information" [@unicode_consortium_unicode_1990]. The explication of such
thick content requires thick description, replete with material detail which
acquires metaphysical significance in practice. The text that edits itself or
one that collects its own fees necessitates new strategies of interpretation.

In this chapter I would like to move us towards a systematic study of format.
The familiar paper paragraph structure already presents several interesting
problems for analysis. In claiming typographical space on a page the paragraph
suggests corresponding mental units. A unit of text becomes also a unit of
thought. But no such structures as paragraphs exist in the mind.
Physiologically, the brain arranges information hexagonally, along the
entorhinal grid [@stensola_entorhinal_2012].

![Forms and formats.](images/forms.png)

Just like there is nothing inherently paragraph-like in the neural arrangement
of neurons in the brain, there is also nothing inherently paragraph-like or
page-like in the arrangement of bits along the surface of electromagnetic
storage. If we could peek inside the machine, we would see forms and
structures particular to computational media. The back of the traditional
paragraph form faces paper. Things get significantly more complicated when the
same rectangular shape begins to mediate between the mind and the page on one
side of comprehension, and the page and the machine on the other. The analysis
of computational forms requires new formalisms and new critical vocabularies
capable of drawing correspondences between disparate systems of ordering and
signification. We are at the moment presented with metaphors of order:
paragraphs, pages, files, and folders. Images of such ordering structures on
the screen look like their paper counterparts, but they represent other, less
familiar ordering structures on disk. These ways of ordering are not
equivalent to each other. They imply differing possibilities and affordances.
Formats mediate between data structures, transforming one into the other
according to predefined rules. The projection---content arranged on the
screen---represents mental image---information stored in the head---which
becomes inscription---information stored in the machine. The complexity of the
interface between these disparate symbolisms stems from the fundamental
incompatibility between incommensurate physicalities. Format specifications
govern the transference of data structures from one medium into the other, at
the point of contact between human, symbol, and machine.

[^ln3-symbolisms]: I am interlacing language from Wittgenstein and Alexander
Galloway. On disparate symbolisms see @wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 45.
On incommensurate physicalities see @galloway_interface_2012, viii.

Formatting rules facilitate the conversion of machine-readable codes into
human-readable text. The structure of such transformations governs the
production, storage, reception, and the dissemination of textual artifacts.
Despite their formative powers, formats continue to elude the critical gaze
because our very concept of form, central to literary analysis, has always
drifted between several contradictory intuitions. The history of formalism, as
I will outline it in the first part of this chapter, contains within it at
least these two conflicting ideas about the nature of literary form. Going
back to the reception of Plato, Hegel, and the Russian formalists, the English
"form" renders at times the material, outward, and apparent shape of something
said, written, or pictured. Yet just as often, critics use "form" in the sense
of a Platonic ideal: abstracted from matter, inward-facing, and in need of
explication. Form in that sense is closer to the idea of an algorithm or
formula: it signifies according to implicit rules.

Here, I would like to augment these two senses of form with a third,
introducing the concept of format into the critical discourse. In the process,
we will observe formats develop from simple machine instructions for
typographical layout to complex meta-literary directives related to the
protection of intellectual property rights, constraints on speech, trade
agreements, the politics of surveillance, and clandestine communication. The
intellectual history of form so considered and based on early twentieth
century documents in aesthetic philosophy will meet the material history of
format in computer science at an early, decisive period in the development of
the discipline. The language of formalism will allow us to perceive an
important structure at the heart of every digital text. The chapter ends with
the notion of a "smart document," an increasingly common instrument of record
capable of policing its own encoded rules of reader engagement: what can be
read, how, and where.

## Concrete and Universal

The intellectual history of formalist thought in literary theory contains
within it at least these two distinct and contradictory ideas about form: one
about the outward shape of the sign and another about the inward structure or
formula that governs semiosis. The distinction is important because it leads
to several conflicting strategies of interpretation. Taken in the sense of
"outward shape," form suggests an aesthetics or even "erotics" of art
[@sontag_against_1966]. In this view, the sign is forever embedded into the
specific contexts of inscription, or alternatively, in the contexts of its
reception. The individual peculiarity of the word in context makes it forever
different from the same word on a different page. Formalism in this sense is
concerned with the unique, distinctive, palpable, and outward physical
attributes of a text. Understood as formula, form suggests a more analytical
approach, aimed at explicating the inward structures---universal rules,
patterns, and archetypes---that shape the production of text from within.
Formal analysis so conceived studies not specific traces or utterances, but
rather the development of ideal forms, which exist somewhat independently of
their specific instantiations. Form in the sense of formula embodies an
abstraction, leading to generalized historical categories like genre and
period. Our ideas about "the novel," for example, or "modernism," or
"post-colonial theory" reflect formal groupings of that kind. The genre
"science fiction" indicates an abstract collection of specific literary works
in that genre. Where palpable form leads to immanent material artifacts, the
abstracted notion of form leads to transcendent ideal categories.

The notion of a "format" occupies the conceptual space somewhere between form
as intrinsic formula and form as extrinsic shape. In what remains a singular
article-length treatment on the topic in literary studies, G. Thomas Tanselle
approaches the concept of formatting from the point of view of textual
criticism---the practice of compiling, editing, annotating, preserving, and
publishing scholarly critical editions of canonical texts. For Tanselle's
purposes, the concept of formatting addresses narrowly something like "the
number of page units placed on the press at one time" [@tanselle_concept_2000,
112-3]. He acknowledges, however, that more broadly speaking, formats refer
also to the "nature and the order of the contents" [@tanselle_concept_2000,
67-8]. In this way, soap operas refer to a format for daytime television. The
format of a journal may be "broadsheet daily" or "tabloid." We could also say
that a soap opera is a kind of a *genre* for television, just like the tabloid
is also in some sense a genre for print publication. Unlike "genre" however,
the notion of formats identifies matter both of particular shape and content.
The soap opera is a kind of a daytime melodrama of a certain length, for
example. It has certain audiences in mind. The format thus speaks both to the
physical properties and to the ideational subject matter of the thing. The
novel is a genre, where the paperback its common format. The novel is
infinitely malleable, where the paperback is fixed by its methods of
manufacturing and distribution. We do not expect scientific textbooks in
paperback, for example, just as we would not expect tabloids to be printed on
expensive stock or to support long-form investigative journalism. The format
captures something about the shape, the design, the style, and the thematics
of the subject matter; it connects, in other words, the where to the what, the
how, and in what order.

With these provisional definitions down on paper, I would like to revisit a
few of the canonical texts from the long history of formalism. It would be
interesting to see, for example, whether Plato's or Hegel's seminal passages
on formal aesthetics fall on the "inward structure" or the "outward shape"
side of the divide I have posited earlier. Whatever the tradition of writing
about form, the concept is usually contraposed to some idea of content: as in
form and content. Content in that sense refers to the stuff being shaped or
arranged, whether by intrinsic law or extrinsic forces. R.G. Collingwood
famously described the distinction between classical and romantic art periods
in terms of the form-content divide. He wrote: "Classical art, in a word,
stands for form; romantic art for content" [@collingwood_form_1929, 335]. In
recent work on computational text generation, Kathleen McKeown wrote that to
produce discourse, writers and speakers "must decide what to say and how to
present it effectively" [@mckeown_text_1992, 1]. Similarly, in her influential
essay "Print Is Flat, Code Is Deep," Katherine Hayles wrote about "the
interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying
strategies" [@hayles_print_2004, 72]. The distinction between the idea of
text, its content, and its presentation, its form, entails the distinction
between the work of art in the abstract sense and the object of art in the
sense of the material artifact. In this way, two slightly diverging editions
of the same text---the various editions of Shakespeare's *King Lear*, to take
a canonical example---nevertheless refer to the same work of art. The work of
art refers to a transcendent idea or content of the work, where the individual
editions or copies are contained within the work's immanent, formal
characteristics.

As an aside, note that what counts for matter belonging to the contingent
physical characteristics of a text and what counts for the content belonging
to its signifying strategies depends on the kind of object at hand. For
example, when reading a novel readers commonly ignore variations in line
length. The length of an average line in Herman Melville's *Moby Dick* changes
with the edition. Line lengths are not usually important in novels, we would
say; they carry no meaning. But when reading poetry, the reader does
understand line length to be an integral part of the text's "signifying
strategies." The distinction between form and content in that sense propagates
a kind of value formation, by which we are asked to separate those attributes
of the text that are meaningful from those that are not. Some notion of form
in that distinction implies disposable form, asking us to identify those
physical attributes of the text that can be omitted in the interpretation or
the reproduction of texts. One can imagine a printer deciding to discard
information about the color of a manuscript's ink for example or to do away
with the idiosyncrasies of a writer's handwriting. Those parts of the text
that are deemed insignificant are omitted, while those deemed significant pass
from the category of contingent "formal" characteristics to its essential
signifying "contents."

The conventional distinction between form and content helps us perceive yet
another sense of "form," by which theorists often identify quite the opposite
to what is meant by form in the sense of a disposable shape. Consider that
under canonical, Platonic definitions, "form" often denotes the essential, not
merely contingent, properties of an object. For Plato, the "essence" or an
"idea" of something (like a chair) exists in an ideal, metaphysical state,
somewhere beyond the confines of the material universe. By contrast, a
physical instantiation of that object (a specific chair) embodies a somewhat
more limited, corrupted even, version of that perfect idea. The task of the
philosopher becomes one of reconstructing the single ideal notion of the
perfect chair from its many imperfect exemplars. A computer scientist will
recognize in this chain of reasoning some of the principles behind
object-oriented programming: a way of building software that works by defining
abstract "object classes" and invoking them into "class instances"
[@hoare_record_1965; @nygaard_history_1981]. The abstract class can further be
modified or extended when called into action. In this way, the abstract
category of "chairs" becomes a given chair, complete with individual flaws and
imperfections. I could, for example, modify the chair by attaching a small
desk. The modified chair remains a chair. As before, flaws and emendations are
considered insignificant when compared to the perfected form of the ideal
chair. In the idealist tradition, ideas provide us with lasting universal
"templates" for instantiation within the contingent and always changing
physical confines of the material world.[^ln3-descartes]

So far, I have been using the term "form" quite liberally, relying on the
reader's intuitions about its use in everyday language. A closer look at the
canonical texts in the original will help us identify the conflicting meanings
that become obvious in translation. In Plato's dialogues we find a number of
words that are sometimes reasonably rendered into the English "form." These
include *eidos* (essence), *idea* (idea), *morphe* (shape), and *phainomena*
(appearance). Compare, for example, the following several translations from
Plato's *Timaeus*. In *Timaeus*, we see the titular character discuss the
nature of the physical world with his collocutor. In a passage that
anticipates the famous "molten wax" analogy in Descartes, Timaeus notices that
some elements, like water, change their appearance [*phantazomenōn*] while
remaining essentially the same substance. Benjamin Jowett translates the
passage as follows:

> Thus, then, as the several elements never present themselves in the same
> form [*phantazomenōn*], how can anyone have the assurance to assert
> positively that any of them, whatever it may be, is one thing rather than
> another?  [@plato_timaeus_1998, 49d]

Compare the above with the translation of the same passage by W.R.M. Lamb, who
renders the Greek *phantazomenōn* into the English "appearance":

> Accordingly, since no one of these ever remains identical in appearance
> [*phantazomenōn*], which of them shall a man definitely affirm to be any one
> particular element and no other without incurring ridicule?
> [@plato_plato_1955, 48d]

Both translations of the Greek *phantazomenōn*, form and appearance, capture
the plain meaning of the passage: the essence of a thing remains even as its
outward appearance changes, taking on a phantasmal, fantastic, ghostly,
imaginable, and even "virtual" shape and appearance (all reasonable English
approximations of the Greek *phantazomenōn*). Accordingly, Jowett translates
*phantazomenōn* (that which is changeable) as "form" and Lamb as "appearance."

Contrast the *Timaeus* passages with the ones in *Cratylus*, about
name-giving. In *Cratylus*, Socrates and Hermogenes discuss the ways in which
words signify things by convention. "What has the carpenter in view when he
makes a shuttle?" Socrates asks. "Is it not something the nature of which is
to weave?" Hermogenes answers. "Well, then, if the shuttle breaks while he is
making it, will he make another with his mind fixed on that which is broken,
or on that form [*eidos*] with reference to which he was making the one which
he broke?" Hermogenes agrees the carpenter would fix his mind on the ideal
form. In that case, we should properly call *that* the real shuttle, Socrates
concludes---his point being that the exact outward appearance of individual
shuttles does not matter as much as the abstracted idea of shuttles. The
abstraction endures even as given instantiations break and shatter. There
exist different types of shuttles, some used to weave wool and some for linen,
but all of them, in Jowett's translation, "must contain the form or ideal
[*eidos*] of shuttle" [@plato_dialogues_1937, 389a-b]. In *Cratylus*, *eidos*
or form stands for the "universal lasting ideal" of all shuttles: exactly the
opposite of *phantazomenōn* as "ephemeral instantiation" in the previous
passage! Yet both *eidos* and *phantazomenōn* were reasonably translated into
the English "form," indicating the way in which the concept is often made to
carry both of these conflicting meanings.[^ln3-plato]

The overdetermination of form persists similarly in many English translations
of G.W.F. Hegel, whose discussion of Platonic forms gives us another
paradigmatic text in the history of formal aesthetics. In his *Lectures on
Aesthetics*, Hegel posits classical art as striving to reach an equilibrium
between its ideational, spiritual content and "the configuration of sensuous
material" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 70]. Characteristically, Hegel's prose is
marked by technical and sometimes idiosyncratic vocabulary. Rather than define
the terms precisely, Hegel saturates his text with semantic cognates. On the
side of "content" [*Inhalt*, *Gehalt*], he evokes words like inner life
[*Innere Lebendigkeit*], feeling [*Empfindung*], soul [*Seele*], and spirit
[*Geist*]. All of these convey a movement inward to a location (if it can be
called such) beyond the physical world, accessible only to the spirit
[*Geist*] or mind [*Gedanken*, *Verstand*]. On the side of "form" (same in
German), Hegel accumulates words like expression [*Ausdruck*] and presentation
[*Darstellung*], but also lines, curves, surfaces, carvings, colors, tones,
word sounds, and generally matter or material [*Linien*, *Krümmungen*,
*Flächen*, *Aushöhlungen*, *Farben*, *Tönen*, *Wortklängen*, *Material*]
[@hegel_werke:_1986, *Einleitung*]. The semantic cluster of words related to
"form" conveys physical (palpable, of this world) and outward-facing
properties, available for examination to the senses (*Sinne*).

In contrasting the dominant aesthetic modes of classical and Romantic periods,
Hegel paints Romanticism as an art that seeks to disengage itself from matter,
reaching the realm of pure self-reflective Spirit. Romanticism, in his words,
is "freed from this immediate existence which must be set down as negative,
overcome, and reflected into the spiritual unity" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 81]. He
writes: "Poetry is the universal art of the spirit which has become free in
itself and which is not tied down for its realization to external sensuous
material; instead, it launches out exclusively in the inner space and the
inner time of ideas and feelings" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 89]. Finally,
"inwardness celebrates its triumph over the external and manifests its victory
in and on the external itself, whereby what is apparent to the senses alone
sinks into worthlessness" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 81]. Romantic art can, in this
way, triumph over the external, material world, reaching, at its apex, what he
calls the stage of "free concrete spirituality" [*freie konkrete Geistigkeit*]
[@hegel_werke:_1986]. The idea overcomes matter to become both free from the
constraints of the deterministic physical universe, yet gaining a measure of
solidity in its tangible instantiation.

Several lines in Hegel's own exposition on Plato's idealism give us a glimpse
of his struggle with the Platonic concept of form. In his "Lectures on
Philosophy," Hegel writes: "The Idea is nothing but what is current with us
under the name of the Universal, when this word is not taken in the sense of
*formal* Universal [*formell Allgemeine*]." The formal universal for him is
"merely a property of things," whereas in his interpretation Plato must be
concerned with the "implicitly" universal (as contrasted with explicitly, or
formally universal). This internal "essence" and "in-and-for-itself existent"
lays a claim to truth alone. Hegel writes: "We translate the Greek word
*eidos* by 'genus' or 'species,'" but when "genus" or "species" are "seized as
a number of similar determinations collected by reflection from several
individuals, to serve as a *mark* for the convenience of the understanding,
then we have the Universal in quite an external form" [@hegel_philosophy_1870,
250]. In other words, as soon as *eidos* is instantiated, it moves from being
an ideal form into an apparent shape, as an epistemological category.

I understand Hegel's problem with "formal Universal" as follows. Imagine
someone were to write "all these cats are subsumed under the category of
'feline.'" The labeled category of "feline" captures a snapshot of what it
means at the moment of its naming. But for Hegel, the true ideal cannot exist
in the name alone: it must continue to exist and develop in the real world. It
is not, in other words, merely a socially constructed (we would say today)
category, but something that "internally distinguishes itself" while remaining
"free in its infinitude and independent" from all attempts to fix it
categorically. The best I can understand this is to think about the
evolutionary process that continues in the species, even as the taxonomy
describing that evolution may remain tied to its fixed ways of expression. No
matter what we call cats, the feline species will continue to change. New and
radically different cats may come into existence---ones no longer covered by
the "external mark" of being "feline," that is by our taxonomical categories.
Yet this would only mean that the ideal of "feline" has developed past human
understanding. Zoologists could, at that point, simply adjust their categories
to include new forms of feline being. Ideal feline being moves on immediately
thereafter, continuing to develop and leaving behind only the husk or a
"snapshot" of what it meant to be a cat in times already past. For Hegel, one
should not confuse that static categorical snapshot with the animate ideal.
For this reason Hegel disparages the "formal universal" as a corrupted, "mere"
form of the ideal.

By contrast to the "formal universal," Hegel's "concrete universal" exists in
the real, physical world. It is more than a category. One way to understand
this difficult concept is to think of it as capturing both *eidos* and
*phantazomenōn*---or idea and appearance, both reasonably transcribed to
"form" in English. In an essay on Hegel's concept, John Crowe Ransom likens
the concrete universal to a "little universe or an organized working
combination of parts." He writes: "Thus the formula of a chemical reaction;
the recipe for a dish; the blue-print of a machine." Crucially, the Hegelian
universal becomes concrete when the machine "has been materialized, and
working properly" [@ransom_concrete_1954, 387]. As was the case with
Wittgenstein's logical mechanisms in the last chapter, Ransom imagines a
perfected kind of a machine or a formula that represents the ideal of the
aesthetic object.

## Strategies of Reading

The above notes on Plato and Hegel are not meant to present a definitive
history of formalism in Western aesthetics. Rather, they point to series of
related folds and creases in that tradition, appearing around the concept of
form with some regularity. W.K. Wimsatt once observed that literary theorists
often persist in making statements that understand a work of literary art to
be, in a peculiar way, "a very individual thing or a very universal thing or
both" [@wimsatt_structure_1947, 262]. A work of art, a poem, understood as
something which "cannot be expressed in other terms" leads to the kind of
criticism that emphasizes the contemplation of the outward, affective,
palpable elements of the text. The function of such criticism, according to
Wimsatt, is to create "approximate descriptions of poems" and "multiple
restatements of their meaning," which aid the reader in coming to their own
"intuitive and full realizations" of literature [@wimsatt_structure_1947,
280]. Understood as an end product of a living ideal or formula, the analysis
of literature seeks to recover latent universal mechanisms, laws, and deep
structures that give rise to surface phenomena.

The dual motion of literary criticism at once towards the extrinsic shape and
intrinsic formula---poetics and hermeneutics---is perhaps most starkly visible
in the intellectual legacy of Russian formalism in the first few decades of
the 20th century. The influential series of "OPOYAZ" publications, appearing
between 1916 and 1920, gave voice to a collective of literary scholars that
included Viktor Shklovsky, Osip Brik, Lev Yakubinsky, Boris Eichenbaum, and
Roman Jakobson, among others. Collectively, the volumes strike out in two
distinct, but complementary directions.

Several essays by Brik, Shklovsky, Yakubinski, and others contrapose "sound"
[*zvuk*] to "symbol" [*obraz*]. Brik writes: "I believe that elements of
symbolic and sonic [*zvukovoi*] art exist simultaneously, and that every given
piece of [poetic] work comprises an equilibrium of these two heterogeneous
poetic impulses" [@shklovksy_sborniki_1917, 25]. Of the sixteen or so unique
essays that appear in the three collected volumes (some of the essays repeat
across volumes), thirteen have the word "sound" [*zvuk*], or some variation
thereof, in the title, in combinations like "sound image," "sound gesture,"
and "sound repetition." To this cluster of essays we may attribute the Russian
formalist concern with *zaum*---literally, beyond sense, or beyonsense---
trans-rational, nonsensical sounds that nevertheless elicit an affective,
lived response, giving voice to ideas that are difficult to explain rationally
[@khlebnivkov_collected_1987, 179; @khlebnikov_king_1990, 151;
@labelle_lexicon_2014, 63].

Poetry in the symbolic mode encodes meaning inwardly: the elephant "stands
for" memory, or the like. *Zaum* poetics instead evoke affect through external
shape, sensually and affectively. Khlebnikov writes that "mystical incantation
and beyonsense are appeals 'over the head' of government straight to the
population of feelings, a direct cry to the predawn of the soul"
[@khlebnikov_king_1990, 152]. Shklovsky similarly defines *zaum* as "without
words but with sound," appealing to the senses rather than the intellect. He
writes:

> Thought and speech cannot keep up with inspired experience, and
for this reason artists are free to express themselves not only in language of
common understanding, but also in private language---language that has no
settled sense [...] Lilacs are beautiful, but how deformed [*bezobrazno*] the
word "lilac," plundered and exhausted. This is why I call a lilac "uao,"
restoring its primal clarity [@shklovksy_poetika_1919, 13].

The word *bezobrazno*, in the meaning of hideous or deformed, literally
translates as "without an image." The word "lilacs" has lost its verbal,
linguistic shape, the author implies. Formalism of the outward kind thus aims
to restore the sensation of an image, returning form, in the sense of a shape,
to habituated content. Formal techniques like chanting or neologism help
revitalize the external sound image. The word loses its sense through
repetition, while gaining a distinct physical sound signature, which goes
unnoticed in everyday use.

Three of the sixteen essays in the seminal volumes I have discussed above
strike in another direction, away from shape and towards formula. Shklovsky's
"Art as Technique," "Linkages between Plot and Style Device," and Eichenbaum's
"How the *Overcoat* Is Made," constitute a cluster of essays that deal with
narrative structure rather than phonetic image.[^ln3-propp] All three authors
cite a common source of influence for this direction of research: namely, the
work of Alexander Veselovsky, the 19th century Russian historian of literature
and founder of the comparative method in that tradition. Veselovsky, a scholar
of the generation previous to the formalists, did not attain the renown
enjoyed by his pupils in the West. An early pioneer of comparative literature,
he advocated philology as a "historical" and "genetic" study of "poetic
consciousness and its forms." Citing literary explorations by Goethe,
Friedrich Schiller, and Georges Polti as his inspiration, Veselovsky almost
always uses the word "form" in the sense of the "formula," and not at all in
the sense of "shape" or "sound." In this, he imagines a rather Hegelian model
of literary evolution, which proceeds through the development of universal
constants, narrative plot sequences for example, which further influence the
development of literary particulars. Veselovsky calls these genetic constants
"vagabond formulas" [@veselovsky_sobranie_1913, 185]. He writes:

> Somewhere, someone gave these plots [*siuzhety*] an apt expression, a
> formula, elastic enough to fit, if not new content, then new interpretations
> of plots rich in their associative possibilities. The formula endures.
> Writers will return to it, altering its significance, expanding its meaning,
> and adopting it to new types. As the formula of "desire" was and continues
> to be repeated, so also are repeated the plots of *Faust* and *Don Juan*
> across the distance of centuries [...] We are connected to a tradition. We
> expand within it---not to create new forms, but to attach to them new
> sentiments and concerns. This dynamic could be considered a kind of a law of
> conservation of energy [@veselovsky_sobranie_1913, 475-47].

[^ln3-propp]: To this strain of formalism one could also adduce Vladimir
Propp's well-known *Morphology of the Folktale*, a text that finds a limited
number of universal principles of composition in the multiplicity of folktale
traditions.

The Hegelian influence is unmistakable in these lines. Like the world spirit,
literary formulae exist and develop across time and space. Veselovsky's
formulas resemble concrete universals, which develop independently of
individual texts. Formulae in this sense have a life of their own, in a trans-
or meta-human way, not fully accessible to the individual author or reader.
They are invoked indirectly. They exist in the ether of culture, attaining a
historical momentum of their own through a process of gradual evolutionary
development. Form, in this Hegelian historical sense, means exactly the
opposite of form in the sense of a private utterance, by which an individual
author breaks with an ossified tradition, as was the case with Shklovsky's
idiosyncratic naming of the flower, *uao*. In one case, the author
participates in the formation of shared culture; in the other, the author
attempts to dissent from the shared cultural norm.

The tension between extrinsic shape and intrinsic rule lies at the heart of
literary theory, manifesting at times under differing yet essentially related
vocabularies. The emphasis on extrinsic shape logically leads to the poetics
of affective reading of the kind that privileges apparent surface phenomena.
The emphasis on intrinsic rules by contrast leads to a hermeneutics or an
archeology of text, by which the critic's role becomes to discover the
non-apparent deep structural regularities. Most recently, that theoretical
distinction between shape and formula has been negotiated in terms of depth
and surface. Two types of reading become evident in this model. The
"symptomatic" literary critic reaches beyond the "ephemeral" external
appearances to uncover internal and eternal metaphysical truth within. For a
Marxist critic like Terry Eagleton or Frederic Jameson that latent meaning may
have something to do with hidden machinations of capital and ideology. The
psychologically minded critic reads in search of hidden drives, desires, or
cognitive structures. By contrast to symptomatic reading, Stephen Best and
Sharon Marcus describe a constellation of reading practices concerned with
"what is evident, perceptible, apprehensible in text: what is neither hidden
nor hiding; what, in the geometrical sense, has length and breadth but no
thickness, and therefore covers no depth." The authors identify a
constellation of related interpretation practices at the surface: reading for
material surface, reading for verbal structure, reading for affect, reading
for description, reading for pattern, and finally, reading for literal meaning
or "just reading" [@best_surface_2009, 9].

In making the argument for surface reading, Best and Marcus gesture toward the
kind of formal poetics advocated by Susan Sontag in the late 1960s. At the
time, Sontag wrote about "the need for more attention to form in art."
Interpretation can be liberating, she wrote, but it can also stifle
creativity. It "depletes" the world in some way, placing the critic in a
privileged and unnecessarily meddling position between reader and text. "If
excessive stress on content provokes the arrogance of interpretation, more
extended and more thorough descriptions of form would silence," she writes.
"The best criticism, and it is uncommon, is of this sort that dissolves
considerations of content into those of form" [@sontag_against_1966, 8-9].
Marcus and Best remind the reader that Sontag's manifesto is not just an
argument against interpretation, but also an "affective and ethical stance"
[@best_surface_2009, 10]. Strategies of "deep" interpretation carry with them
also a claim to privileged access, along with an imbalance of interpretive
acumen. The critic asserts to uncover what the lay reader does not and
supposedly cannot see without expert guidance. As an ethical stance, reading
for external forms by contrast flattens the hierarchy between the lay reader
and the professional interpreter. In this sense, Best, Marcus, and Sontag
continue in the liberal, Lutheran tradition of vernacular exegesis. All
readers are priests at the surface; all readers are capable, the critics
suggest, of forming their own interpretation.

Interpretation at the level of meaning and content alone for Sontag is an
intellectual and ultimately reactionary activity. It aims to find "the maximum
amount of content" within. It is reactionary because it serves only to
multiply the available "levels of analysis." In explicating the work of art,
the critic merely creates alternate copies that diverge from the original.
Each layer of criticism thus only adds to the content of the work, placing
additional burden on the readers to come. In Sontag's words, to "design" a
work of art that can be experienced in this way, always on multiple and
diverging levels of ideation, might have been "creative" and "revolutionary"
in the age of aesthetic paucity, when creativity and interpretation were
limited to a few privileged individuals. By contrast, Sontag believes that her
times are a period of creative abundance. "Think of the sheer multiplication
of works of art available to all of us," she writes. Contemporary culture is
rather based on "excess" and "material plenitude" which dull the senses
[@sontag_against_1966, 9-10]. In such conditions, the production of further
critical variations on the theme only adds to the dulling clutter.

By "interpretation," Sontag means a "conscious act of the mind" that
illustrates a "certain code" or "certain rules" of literary engagement. It is,
for her, "virtually" a type of translation. The critic "transforms" and
"revamps" the text: X turns out to be A, Y turns out to be B, and so on
[@sontag_against_1966, 3]. By "form" Sontag means something like the apparent,
perceptual properties of the work: one sentence is long, for example, another
short. A critic could "make something out of" the variation, but Sontag wants
to stop us short of meaning making. A discipline of careful perception---of
paying attention to---can sharpen readers' sensibilities, preparing them for
an independent interpretive strategy of their own. There is no need to explain
under this model, only describe. The history of interpretation Sontag objects
to is one that privileges content over form. The words "explication" and
"exegesis" imply the movement from the inside to the outside. For a
psychoanalytical critic interpretation in that sense may mean revealing the
hidden psychological drives that give rise to a particular form of an
expression. A Marxist critic may instead look for the concealed operation of
this or that ideology. Fredrick Jameson, a prominent Marxist critic, writes
for example:

> Thus the process of criticism is, not so much the interpretation of
content, as it is a revealing of it, a laying bare, a restoration of the
original message, the original experience, beneath the distortions of the
various kinds of censorship that have been at work upon it; and this
revelation takes the form of an explanation of why the content was so
distorted and is thus inseparable from a description of the mechanisms of the
censorship itself [@jameson_marxism_1972, 404].

Form in the sense of "outward shape" suggests an emphasis on what Susan Sontag
deemed the "sensory experience" or the "erotics" of art. In "Against
Interpretation" Sontag mentions the ideal of transparency as the "highest,
most liberating value in art and in criticism today." "Transparency means
experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself, of things being what
they are" she explains [@sontag_against_1966, 9]. Rather than to show what a
work of art *means*, Sontag urges critics to show "how it is" and "that it is"
[@sontag_against_1966, 10]. To make her argument Sontag relies on the
distinction between "meaning" or "content" on the one hand and "form" or the
"sensory experience" of the work on the other. Form, in this sense, mirrors
McKeown's "shape" and the "text's physical characteristics" of Hayles.

## Format Theory

If reading for sensory experience implies an erotics of art and reading for
hidden formulae implies a hermeneutics, what would it mean to read for format?
To borrow from Tanselle's vocabulary, the format bridges the "physical
structure of finished books" with their "intellectual content." This
connection happens through what Tanselle calls "printing-shop routines" and
what we began to identify in the previous chapter as a kind of a technique for
the transformation of ideas into inscription-things. The scholar interested in
formatting traditionally arbitrated in the conflict between the extant textual
witnesses that individually contain slightly differing versions of the same
text, but in aggregate identify the sum total of a given work in the
abstract.[^ln3-printers] The scholar of format studies how works become texts
and the other way around. It is in this sense of arbitration, for example,
that the textual critic C. Deirdre Phelps describes the notion of physical
form in textual criticism. When instantiating the ideal text into its concrete
being, publishers introduce textual changes that may or may not correspond to
either authorial intention or the reader's expectations. For example, we could
imagine an inexpensive edition of poetry by William Blake that was to be
printed without illustrations, to save costs, where we know such illustrations
to be integral to the meaning of his work. If we subsequently lose all other
editions of Blake's poetry, the textual critic may be interested in
reconstructing the bibliographic genealogy of this one edition to understand
something about the life of the work and about the choices that have led to
the perceived loss of fidelity to a certain tradition of publishing Blake.
"The textual critic is concerned mainly with the fact of the [textual] change
itself," Phelps writes [@phelps_edition_1994, 65-6].

[^ln3-printers]: See for example the discussion on the limits of the inductive
method in bibliographic study in @mckenzie_making_2002, 16-17. See also
@mcgann_socialization_1991; @tanselle_textual_1996.

Various schools of textual criticism emphasize differing aspects of the
publication process. Some privilege the notion of authorial intent, others
publisher's discretion or the audience's expectations. Whatever these choices
imply, they continue to determine value, in a process that separates those
physical attributes meaningful to the work from those that are not. For
example, in their contemporary online edition of Claude McKay's 1922
collection of poems *Harlem Dawn*, the editors made the decision to encode
indentation, preserving the perceived integrity of the poem's visual line
structure. However, they have also allowed for the text to wrap when viewed on
small devices, in effect "soft wrapping" those lyrical lines that are too long
to fit on a small screen [@mckay_harlem_2015]. The end result is a compromise
between authorial intent and a reader's convenience. The layout respects line
indentation but not line length. Other solutions were possible, of course. The
editors could have chosen to recreate an exact graphical facsimile of a
particular print edition, which would not render well on small screens due to
the disparity in size. The choice to preserve certain attributes of formatting
while suppressing others identifies those elements particularly meaningful to
the editors. In the most extreme case, we could imagine an editor wanting to
preserve all of a text's details, down to the molecular structure of the
original. Such a text could be accompanied by a potentially unlimited amount
of metadata describing the precise physical contexts of the universe
surrounding the authoritative version. To reproduce the text faithfully would
mean to reproduce the world around it. We do not, however, as readers, usually
care for the entirety of a text's physical attributes. Contingent stains or
scratches in the manuscript, typos in the critical edition, printer error,
pages inadvertently bound upside down, and other flaws are usually discarded
in reproduction. They are not seen as meaningful for the understanding of
text.

When we think of a canonical text---Shakespeare's *King Lear*, for
example---whatever is meant by the "format" of the play belongs neither wholly
to its physical medium (pixel or paper) nor to the ideational content of the
work. Format, in that sense, lies somewhere between the two worlds: it is in
the shape of the letters, in the structure of the narrative, and in the
patterns of stress and the intonation of the spoken word. We do not quite know
which of these elements belong to the content of the play and which are linked
to the contingent material artifacts of the printing or staging process: the
way the fonts look, for example, or the way lines break on the page. Some
matters of format matter to readers (line breaks in poetry, for example),
while others usually do not (font kerning, for example). The tradition of
textual criticism reminds the literary theorist of the transition that happens
between literary texts and literary works. The transformation between ideas
and things is always a fraught process, because whatever the theorist may
believe about the dynamics of interpretation must be weighed against the
material affordances of the specific textual witness. A word or comma omitted
from text, a forgotten line, cannot ever become a part of the meaning making
processes. Format stands at the gates of hermeneutics. It is the ultimate
arbiter of interpretation.

[^ln3-remind]: See for example @shillingsburg_being_2006;
@greetham_textual_1989.

In an essay on pictographs and pictographic logic, Johanna Drucker and Jerome
McGann write about the "presentational form of texts" which usually masks
their "logical operations in a surface rhetoric that dominates and controls
our conscious attention." "The physicality of textual marks and shapes
disappear in an act of reading determined to highlight certain kinds of
conceptual references (content)," they continue. At the same time, what the
authors call the "holistic repleteness of images" also keeps us from
perceiving their "conceptual order [...] as if the graphic character of the
work were completely obvious" [@drucker_images_2010]. This important insight
captures the dual movement of formatting at once towards the physical
characteristics of the text and towards the mental characteristics of content.
The reader understands the text as an idea, that takes shape in the mind. The
book thus retreats from grasp, as Percy Lubbock wrote in *The Craft of
Fiction* [@lubbock_craft_1921]. Subsequently, readers tend to treat text in a
disembodied fashion---as surface rhetoric---reading past the material
structures that support mental phenomena. As visual phenomenon, a unified
image, the page presents itself in its entirety, at once, in what the Drucker
and McGann call its "holistic repleteness." It is as if it was always so:
these words were always in this order, at these coordinates. However, the
printer and the book designer know the image to be a carefully constructed
composite. They understand and can name the particulates of page composition
invisible to the lay reader. Drucker and McGann conclude that "systems of
graphic presentation are operational, not merely passive schematic structures
[...] active agents for creating meaning, instructions for reading, viewing,
comprehending information [@drucker_images_2010]. Choices were made, in other
words, that would later affect meaning making. Apprehension precedes
comprehension. The processes of interpretation have long began and in some
cases concluded long before the reader laid eyes on the page.

We are finally confronted with several concrete differences between print and
digital formats for text resolution. Editors and textual scholars negotiate
the instruction codes that govern reading, viewing, and interpretation
strategies in print in advance of publication. The choice to include or to
exclude certain words, versions, or visual elements of the text is fixed into
the final proof of the page, where it remains statically in place for the
duration of a book's existence. The book itself provides a stable platform for
a range of reading practices, which include the annotation, copying, and
preservation of written work. To the extent that books determine the
affordances of reading, those affordances exhibit historical continuity. For
example, the book format requires as a precondition of reading certain
physical capacities: manual dexterity, for example, a level of cognitive
development, and eyesight within a specific range of vision. Readers falling
outside of these normalized ranges are prevented from accessing the text in
the manner specified. The book further affords abilities like highlighting and
the taking of notes. Empty space on a page around the text facilitates
marginalia. For the highlighter or the pen to function well the printing
medium must be made of a porous material, and not, for example, plastic, which
would make marking the page difficult while affording other capabilities, like
reading under water.[^ln3-notes]

[^ln3-notes]: See @blair_note_2004; @daston_taking_2004; @piper_note_2012.

The affordances of the electronic book are more diffuse. The format of the
book has been replaced with a multitude of competing digital formats, each
vying to supplant print to become the singular, unified reading platform.
Software made by Adobe Systems, the company behind the popular Portable
Document Format, includes Adobe Digital Editions, which the reader can use "to
download and purchase digital content, which can be read both online and
offline." The platform's "features" include the ability to "download and
transfer books between devices," "searching eBooks," support for multiple
languages, the ability to borrow books, printing, limited support for visually
impaired readers, bookmarking, highlights, notes, and file organization
[@_plans_2016]. Its own competing Adobe Document Cloud reading platform
includes the Free, Standard, and Pro versions of Acrobat Reader, "the global
standard for reliably viewing, printing, and commenting on PDF documents"
[@_adobe_2016]. Only the most expensive Pro version allows one to "create and
validate PDFs to meet accessibility standards for people with disabilities."
The free version does not support bookmarks or document editing. The Pro
version enables readers to "redact and permanently remove sensitive
information in PDFs" and to "compare two versions of a document to see what's
changed" [@_plans_2016]. The Amazon Kindle reader, made by the world's largest
purveyor of books both print and electronic, includes a feature called "Public
Notes" which allows Kindle customers to "make their highlights and notes
available for anyone to see" [@_amazon_2015]. The frequently asked question
page further explains that "if someone you follow has highlighted a passage in
a book and has turned on Public Notes for the book, you'll see that passage
highlighted along with the name of the person who highlighted it." The FAQ
continues to tout the benefits of their platform:

> Now authors, thought leaders, passionate readers, professors and all Kindle
users can opt-in to share their notes with other readers, helping friends,
family members, and other Kindle users who choose to follow them to get more
from their reading. If someone you follow has highlighted a passage in a book
and has turned on Public Notes for the book, you'll see that passage
highlighted along with the name of the person who highlighted it. You'll also
see the notes that they made in the book [@_amazon_2016].

The Google Play Books platform does not have the public note features nor does
it support book editing. It does however add the ability to translate words
and passages and to search for selected phrases using the company's search
engine [@_read_2016]. In short, the electronic book cannot be reduced to a
single platform. The affordances of reading, taking notes, sharing, and
storing books are determined by the software, governed by specific
socio-economic contingencies. Thus a book available in North America, might be
be available on other continents, or it could be available elsewhere in a
redacted form, its content tailored to the reader's geography dynamically.

In each case, Adobe and Amazon, we observe an attempt to supplant the
affordances of the book with a range of other, competing affordances
particular to the company's proprietary document format. The Amazon book and
the Kindle book are read in different ways. Where the mechanics of the book
are relatively well-known---the way paper absorbs ink or the hinge-like action
of the spine and boards---we are yet to discover the potentialities of
electronic reading. Or, rather, the potentialities of electronic reading
change dynamically, day to day, with each software update. The electronic book
is not one format, but many, each entailing a number of emendatory
compromises. They require a book history and the poetics in another sense, on
the material level, at the source of knowledge production.

Contrary to the above remarks, my notes on the diffuse affordances of the
electronic book hold true only for interaction through the sanctioned "front
end" modes of interaction with digital literary artifacts. For example, note
that all of the major book platforms I have mentioned so far are coupled
tightly with their respective book markets. Both Amazon and Adobe sell books
in a way that is not compatible with one another, nor with other electronic
book platforms. Further, note that whatever the comparative affordances of
reading an Amazon ebook versus the book expressed in the Adobe Document Cloud,
the software must emulate the logics of document ownership. To own an
electronic book or a document implies the ability to perform significantly
differing actions depending on the specific affordances of the given platform.
In another sense, to own a book in each case means to have access to the bits
that bring the simulation of the book into existence. At some lower level of
abstraction the variety of reading platforms rests on the same computational
substratum. Both Amazon and Adobe books rely on the underlying capabilities of
the personal computer. This hyper-media, as Lev Manovich calls it, at the base
of all competing ebook formats, supports all simulacra, including the
bibliographic [@manovich_software_2013]. Whatever it means to own a book, must
involve manipulating bits on a hard drive. A common act of epistemic
disobedience, to borrow a phrase from Walter Mignolo, therefore includes
accessing the book bits directly, through channels not afforded by the
publisher [@mignolo_epistemic_2009]. One can in this way disentangle the
mechanisms of book ownership as defined by Amazon, from the book's "content"
proper, by other definitions. The so called "ripping" of the Kindle book
library involves reformatting individual books into other file formats which
could hypothetically enable unfettered copying and circulation of the text,
constrained by the original platform. The activity need not be illicit. The
extraction of plain text from the Portable Document Format commonly
constitutes the initial step in corpus analysis, natural language processing,
and otherwise distant reading. We lend our books to friends, read them out
loud with our students, and make backup copies for our home libraries.

In each of the above examples, the reader confronts some aspect of formatting
instrumentally, for a particular purpose like copying, analysis, or
preservation. I am however also interested in a more systematic wholesale
exposition of electronic document structure. Reading for format involves the
deconstruction, both literal and figuratively historical, of the literary
device. Where paper books present the reader with a limited number of known
affordances tied to the medium of print, electronic books contain a virtually
limitless and for the most part unexamined number of simulated affordances.
Whatever interpretive activity readers hope to enact at the level of textual
representation, as when reading from a screen, is grounded in the deep
material affordances of the simulated book. Further, the tasks of formatting
are no longer the exclusive domain of the typesetter, the editor, or the
textual scholar. A number of additional agents actively intercede in the
transformation between the inscription---information on a disk---and its
representation---pixels on the screen. These intercessions may be benign, as
when the electronic book changes the layout of the text to fit a smaller
screen when displaying text on mobile devices; or it may be totalizing as when
a book platform is designed also to censor or to surveil its readers for
commercial or political purposes. Reading for format reveals the structure of
the transformation between media: the liquid crystal, the floating gate, and
the entorhinal grid. The format governs and controls in the sense of shaping
the encounter between otherwise incommensurate systems, hardware and
wetware---storage, screen, and brain.

A notion of a format underlies all contemporary digital documents. The history
of format reveals a structure that emerges initially for the purposes of
visual layout, developing into an active agent containing exactly the kind of
"instructions for reading, viewing, and comprehending information" of the sort
Drucker and McGann highlight in their work. With that insight at hand, I would
like to spend the second half of this chapter on several case studies from the
still unwritten history of document formatting. These case studies will help
test our theoretical intuitions about form in practice. They serve also to
convince the reader of the continual importance of textual criticism and
format studies for the advancement of literary scholarship and more broadly
for the politics of reading and interpretation at large. The formatting layer
arbitrates between medium and inscription, page and word. It is arbitrary in
the sense of imposing a number of contingent rules, preferences, and
stipulations. It polices access to closed archives; it manages copy rights and
borrowing privileges; it governs the flow of a sensor's ink. Format in that
sense determines the available reading strategies, including the one of not
reading at all.

![EDIT Document Model, 1968 [@kaiman_computer-aided_1968, 66].](images/edit.png)

Describing *EDIT*, one of the first editors designed for the GE635 36-bit
mainframe computers in use at Bell Labs in 1968, Arthur Kaiman wrote: "The
publication editor is divided into three related sections, the document layout
facility, the editing facility, and the printing facility"
[@kaiman_computer-aided_1968, 66]. The "layout," in Kaiman's vocabulary,
contains such things as justification, indentation, and spacing. These
"primitive requests" can be combined to describe more complex "structures of
the printed text." The creators of *QED*, another influential early text
editor (created for the SDS-930 time-sharing system at Berkeley) similarly
encouraged the writer "to think in terms of structure" of the text. *QED* and
*EDIT* were some of the first text editors to separate notions of "content"
and "formatting," which were meant to be recombined later and imprinted onto
external storage media. Kaiman explains that "the user types the document
layout file and the text file, then produces a proof or master copy of the
text by printing the text according to the directions of the layout file. The
text file contains layout marks to be interpreted by the layout file." "Text,"
in this schema, constitutes content meaningful only to the user, whereas
layout contains some elements meaningful to the human and some elements as
code instructions intended for device control. Crucially: "no document text
may appear in the layout file" [@kaiman_computer-aided_1968, 66-8]. Layout in
that sense asks the human editor to make a distinction between semantic and
spatial units: words and their coordinates. These two separate streams of data
are then stored in two discrete locations, in effect embodying the dichotomy
between format and content.

The same distinction can be observed in FORMAT and TROFF, both early and
influential text processors developed in the 1960s-1970s. IBM's FORMAT text
program, written in FORTRAN IV for OS/360 devices in 1968, discusses
formatting in terms of "text control." "All input to FORMAT is free-form, in
that there are no positional constraints," the author of the program writes
[@berns_format_1968, 85; @berns_description_1969, 141]." Text control under
the FORMAT model was limited to several "command words" that included "P" for
"begin new paragraph," "T" for "tab," and "A" for "print 'as is', maintaining
spacing of the input" [@berns_description_1969, 141]. EDIT also had the
capability of building an index, in effect listing all the unique words in any
given document, along with a rudimentary facility for search, or in its own
words for "locating text words, phrases, and strings in the input stream"
[@berns_format_1968, 91; @berns_description_1969, 145]. In another formative
paper in the history of contemporary textuality, Brian Kernighan and Joseph
Ossanna describe TROFF, a text processor written circa 1973 for the PDP-11
outputting to Graphic Systems Cat typesetter. In 1979, Kernighan reports
modifying the original program to produce output for a greater variety of
typesetters. Kernighan explains, "TROFF produces its output in a
device-independent form," and its output "must be processed by a drive for
that device to produce printed output" [@kernighan_troff_1992]. Neither
program makes an ontological claim on the textual artifact. Rather, the idea
of text independent of its medium and "free of form" is present in both
specifications as matter of contingency. The writer enters text in one
location, without knowing its output in another. For this reason, the
program's designers must differentiate between the content of the document and
its spatio-temporal characteristics; some elements are to be represented,
while others control the structure of representation.

More than a decade later, reflecting on the proliferation of text editors, a
group of computer scientists from the University of Washington advanced the
following unified theory of format. "A *document* is an object composed of a
hierarchy of primitive objects," the group writes. The objects are further
divided into "abstract" or "logical" objects and their "concrete"
instantiations. The authors explain: "an abstract object is denoted by an
identifier and the class to which the object belongs." By contrast, concrete
objects occupy "one or more two-dimensional page spaces and represent the
possible formatted images of abstract objects" [@furuta_document_1982, 418].
In other words, the concrete object gives physical shape, layout, or style to
the instantiation of abstract universal classes like paragraphs and sentences.
Concrete objects are abstract paragraphs and sentences "laid out" in page
space. In this schema, the word "cat" embodies a concrete object, a physical
inscription at a given location. It further denotes the identifier for the
idea of "cat," which belongs to the class "word". Note that by this model,
cats are not classified under the their semantic category of "felines."
Rather, we are concerned with the abstract type of the identifier itself:
"cat" belongs to the category "word." Other primitive classes include
paragraphs, chapters, titles, and footnotes, for example. A document can
subsequently be expressed as a hierarchical ordering of such primitive
objects. In this way, we may think of a "novel" as an abstract succession of
"chapters," which in turn encapsulate "paragraphs" that contain "sentences and
words," further composed of "characters." These abstract units must then find
their physical manifestation on a page. They stand in a hierarchical
relationship to each other because paragraphs contain sentences, and sentences
words, and not the other way around. Together, primitive object classes
constitute more sophisticated abstractions like "letters," "articles,"
"books," and "journals" [@furuta_document_1982, 417-19; @shaw_model_1980].

The class / instance distinction gives us the vocabulary to discuss editing
and formatting tasks in terms of state transformations. In this way, editing
the document involves the transition between abstract states, as when the
author corrects spelling for example. Concrete to concrete editing transitions
can involve the sequential rearrangement of sentences or paragraphs, or moving
data from one table to another. Crucially for our discussion, the authors
define formatting as the reification of abstract classes into the real: the
application of font styles, for example. Formatting in that sense converts
what the authors call the "intended document" into the "visible concrete
document." Between these two polarities we observe the document description,
at which stage content and physical text specifications are mixed together and
laid out for viewing on a particular device [@furuta_document_1982, 419-22].
This last part is important, as many systems are designed to display text
without "knowing" in a sense the ultimate physical dimensions of target
output. We can think for example of document files that are rendered in more
or less the same way on a multitude of screens of varying sizes. Nothing in
the code guarantees the dimensions of the visible concrete document. We are
only assured of their proper structure: that the paragraphs will have a
certain spacing, that the footnotes appear on the bottom of the page not on
the top, and so on.

One can think of examples of other formatting operations which move in the
opposite direction: from concrete to abstract for example. This happens in
optical character recognition (OCR), as part of a process by which images of
physical pages are converted into an "intended," abstract structure, the
"content" thereby lifted from the physical page. A text in the portable
document format (.pdf) remains a graphic image---a concrete, indivisible
object---until the text is recognized. One can read it of course but it does
not, from the machine's point of view, contain text or "abstract objects" as
such. Leaving aside the somewhat strained language in which machines have
views and cognitive states like recognition---recognition in this case implies
more narrowly the conversion of image into text, converting "image" type data
structures into "text" types. Text, in that sense, lies at the innermost
location within a series of nested "outer" containers. Lacking a model of
"comprehension" or "understanding," the machine posits text as "content" in
the sense of it being the "innermost" object of human recognition.

The "recognition" of letters does not exhaust the variety of abstract document
objects that could be gleaned from the bibliographic image, which besides
letters and words also includes paragraphs, tables, titles, and footnotes
along with numerous other elements. These also must count as "content," in
some sense of the word because they are semantic, rather than purely graphic
units. They mean something to the reader. It is essential therefore to know
"where text resides on the page," since many elements of text positioning in
themselves carry meaning. For instance, proper names carry different
connotations depending on their positioning on the page. A name in the "author
field" means something distinct from any other name mentioned in the body of
the document. Lawrence O'Gorman, an influential researcher in the field of
document image processing, calls the recognition of this sort of object, at
the intersection of concrete and universal, "document lay-out understanding,"
which consists of "functional labeling of blocks [...] distinguished in some
way by their physical features (such as by font size) and by the 'meaning' of
the block [@ogorman_document_1993, 1162-63; @ogorman_document_1995, 82-99 (in
the reconstructed edition)]." Note also that document layout (alternatively
"formatting" or the arrangement of "concrete objects") could also incorporate
meaningless (to humans) structures, such as the incidental "rivers" of empty
space formed between the words. That sort of concrete structure goes
unrecognized because it does not correspond to any abstract objects in the
available document object taxonomy.[^ln3-river]

[^ln3-river]: There are also genres of literature where the rivers do become
meaningful, as in concrete poetry, for example.

![Method for extracting document structure based on "nearest-neighbor clustering
of page components" [@ogorman_document_1993, 1164].](images/docstrum.png)

Finally, we may describe *viewing* or *printing* a document as a chain of
formatting operations that transform one type of concrete object, bits
arranged spatially on the disk into another type of concrete object, pixels
arranged in space on a screen or ink on a page. Something called the Document
Object Model describes that chain of transformations in detail, containing in
essence an intermediary map or a blueprint of the intended document. The
blueprint is not quite concrete, however, because the machine must anticipate
a number of possible two-dimensional spaces like pages and screens of
differing sizes, signifying relationships between elements within a range of
possible concrete objects.[^ln3-dom] In order to materialize, the hierarchical
model must be arranged and fixed into the surface of an actual medium,
according to predefined rules specified in the model. These media have actual
dimensions.  In this way, a footnote specified "at the bottom of the page" at
the level of the model can then be rendered one way at the bottom of a
specific page of a certain size, like A1 (841mm × 1,189mm) for example, and in
another way at the bottom of another specific piece of paper of a much smaller
A4-sized sheet (210mm × 297mm).[^ln3-iso216] Viewing and printing operations
constitute a movement opposite to that of optical character recognition. In
printing a document, the machine creates a static image, which flattens out
the layers of content and visual style. Abstract objects specified by the
abstract model are then reified into a set of relationships between specific
concrete objects on the page [@furuta_document_1982, 419-20;
@kimura_structure_1984].

SCRIPT and the related Generalized Markup Language (GML) developed in the late
1960s by IBM (originally for use on the CP67/CMS time-sharing system), and now
at the basis of ubiquitous XML and HTML markup languages through ISO 8879,
describes a number of such text transformations that occur to "generate the
proper output form." In the process of formatting, SCRIPT represents the
"logical topology" of text in its "canonical form" to produce an "intermediate
data structure," which it then "'unfolds' all at once" by "'peeling' the data
structure one level at a time" [@madnick_script_1968, 97].

!["System Command and Data Flow." Flows and transformations between data
structures at "disk file" level and text structures at the "user terminal" and
the "line printer" levels [@madnick_script_1968, 98].](images/script.png)

The idea format must not be reduced to the mere application of visual style to
words. Formatter designers from TROFF to FORMAT explicitly describe their
programs in terms of instrumental *control*. For example, Richard Berns, the
IBM engineer-developer of FORMAT, writes that in his program, "text control"
aims to accomplish four "basic" tasks: "to read the input, to interpret and
convert the input as required; to keep the document flowing smoothly from line
to line, column to column, and page to page, unless otherwise instructed, and
to break this automatic flow as directed." In FORMAT, the document consists of
text and intermixed "command words" [@berns_description_1969, 141]. The *TROFF
User's Manual* describes text processing in terms of accepting "lines of text
interspersed with lines of format control information" [@kernighan_troff_1992,
3]. Because format concerns both meaning-carrying and purely decorative
elements, text control can involve operations like "replace word," "make
invisible," or "insert file." These commands intertwine with "free-form"
abstract and ideational content at the formatting level, to come apparent in
the "viewing" stage of text processing, where the layers flatten across "a
two-dimensional space" in view of the user. In this onion-like, layered way
formatting instructions govern the reification of abstract content models into
specific documents, shaping the idea in the process of becoming a thing.

## Smart Contracts

Reading for format involves the reconstruction of rules that govern the
transformation of text, thereby creating a notion of literal surface and depth
that differs from their figurative senses. Metaphorically speaking, textual
depth refers to concealed structures of meaning, literary formulae,
signification, or ideology. In another, more literal sense, depth refers to
the formation of literary laminates that hold the inscription in suspense
between layers of glass, plastic, liquid crystal, aluminum, iridium, and
oxide. The move between paper and such *composite media* carries with it a
profound shift in the physical affordances of the everyday document. Not much
space separates ink from paper. There, textuality lies flat, in two
dimensions. What you see is truly what you get. Not so on the screen connected
to other drives, keyboards, and screens. Networked textuality extends into the
third dimension, away from the reader and deep into the bowels of the machine.

Stretched between the sites of its archive and its projection, the solid state
drive and the screen, the inscription travels along a long "pipeline" of
protocols, undergoing arbitrary transformations throughout. On one device,
that pipeline may extend just a few inches, connecting disk storage to output
display. On a networked device that pipeline can stretch across continents,
spanning widely divergent regions of legal and administrative governance. The
data that assembles the nearby object we call an electronic book may be stored
on a server on the other side of the country. Whatever the case may be, the
reader encounters the "protocol stack" from without on the periphery of the
onion-like network. When paging through an electronic book, usually an
OSI-compliant device, the reader has access only to the outputs emanating from
the application layer, and, at that, only at the exposed "window" level of the
document-object model. The perceived "content" therefore comprises only a
small fraction of the underlying formal topology. What you see is far less
than what you get.

I would like to conclude this chapter with a glimpse of several obvious
formatting structures that increasingly mediate in numerous everyday acts of
contemporary reading. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
of communication, implemented in every computer including electronic book
readers, describes no less than seven layers of communication involved in the
simple act of sending an email, taking notes in the margins of a networked
book, or reading a newspaper online.[^ln3-osi] It includes, among others, the
Application Layer, concerned with the semantics of "all services directly
comprehensible to the user," the Presentation Layer, which defines the syntax
for the "representation of the data to be transferred," and the Physical
Layer, providing the "mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural
characteristics" of communication.[^ln3-layers] The specifics of the technical
documentation are not important for now. Consider only the complexity of the
entire stratified structure, in which whatever is meant by "content" is
enveloped within a multiplicity of standards, references, models, and formats
[@miller_iso_1981, 285; @ncs_open_1981; @ncs_national_1988;
@day_revised_1995].[^ln3-domlayer] These are not hypothetical considerations.
They define the medium---the physical preconditions---of digital, simulated
text.

![A zoomed out view of the connected OSI model. Single node structure on the
left. Connected devices on the right. The user has access through the top-most
(application) level, outermost to the network [@piatkowski_iso-ansi_1980,
114-15].](images/osi.png)

In his book on protocols, Alexander Galloway discussed the Open Systems
Interconnection model in reference to what he calls the distributed and
decentralized networks of control [@galloway_protocol_2006, 28-54]. The OSI
standard can be called distributed to be sure, although to what extent it is
decentralized is a matter of some debate. Like a good soldier, each device in
the network of textual machines connected to other textual machines
internalizes dozens if not hundreds of protocols that enable the system to
function seamlessly as a whole, in the way, for example, that your portable
electronics can at one moment connect to one wireless access point, and at
another moment to another, with minimal loss of connectivity. Nevertheless,
communication protocols and document object model hierarchies are also densely
consolidated. They are, for example, legislated by specific international
governing bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium, with a member list that
includes government organizations and large corporate interests.[^ln3-w3c]

The reading subject interacts with the application layer and therefore with
the dynamics of text transformation only superficially. Access to deeper
layers is sometimes merely obscured by the complexity of technology. At other
times, it is made illicit outright, as is arguably the case with U.S. Code,
Title 17, Chapter 12, §1201, titled "Circumvention of copyright protection
systems," a law passed as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
in 1998. A literary scholar may be familiar with similar provisions of
American copyright law governing text as surface representation: US Code,
Title 17, for example, extends "exclusive rights" to "copyright owners" of
"literary works." The rights include the ability to "reproduce," "to prepare
derivative works," "to distribute copies," and "to perform and to display
publicly" (17.1.106). Surface representation is further subject to
professional rules of conduct, embodied in practices of quotation, citation,
and attribution (or lack thereof, as plagiarism). In practice, the easy
reproducibility of digital media has served to erode the efficacy of copyright
restrictions. The work of art in the age of digital reproduction has lost much
of its already tenuous hold on the material substratum.[^ln3-illusion]
Photocopiers, desktop printers, inexpensive digital storage drives, and
peer-to-peer file sharing networks reduce the carries to the copying and the
dissemination of media.

The response from the film, game, music, and publishing industries has been to
transpose mechanisms of copyright enforcement from legal down to the
infrastructural levels of enforcement, as software and hardware: from Code to
code. In the words of Charles Clark, the late British publisher and prominent
copyright attorney, "the answer to the machine is in the machine
[@clark_copyright_1996, 81-82]"---by which he meant that copyright enforcement
should be taken up on the device level by the International Standards
Organization, the same legislative body responsible for maintaining the
standards for the Document Object Model and the OSI communication protocol
stack [@clark_copyright_1996, 84]. As an example of how that might work, Clark
cites the Copyright in Transmitted Electronic Data Report (CITED), which
suggests building "a tamper proof software module which acts rather like
indestructible tachometers installed on long-distance coaches and lorries,
recording everything that happens to the copyrighted or commercially valuable
material [...] The basic idea is to link the 'valuable material' of
intellectual property to a specific piece of software and hardware"
[@consortium_c.i.t.e.d._1994; @clark_copyright_1996, 83-84].

The emergence of such embedded contractual enforcement mechanisms can be
subsumed under the broader idea of "smart contracts." In his seminal article
on "Formalizing and Securing Relationships in Public Networks," Nick Szabo
explained that "smart contracts combine protocols, user interfaces, and
promises expressed via those interfaces to formalize and secure relationships
over computer networks" [@szabo_formalizing_1997]. Clark, CITED, and Szabo
were instrumental in the rise of smart contracts in the 1990s in an attempt to
redress the fading efficacy of legal copyright protections.[^ln3-smart] US
patent 5845281, issued in 1998, containing the "Method and System for Managing
a Data Object so as to Comply with Predetermined Conditions for Usage," is
instructive in this regard. Greg Benson and Gregory H. Urich, both of Sweden,
write:

> The data object owner may want to have permanent secure control over how,
when, where, and by whom his property is used. Furthermore, he may want to
define different rules of engagement for different types of users and
different types of security depending on the value of particular objects. The
rules defined by him shall govern the automated operations enabled by data
services and networking. The owner may also sell composite objects with
different rules governing each constituent object. Thus, it is necessary to be
able to implement variable and extensible control.

The data object, in this case, stands for any media content, from books to
music, video, and software. Rather then legislating rules for copying and
distributing media, the inventors suggest that the medium itself should
contain a control layer that would "comply with predetermined conditions of
usage," in a way that can be "universally adapted to the needs of both the
owner and the user of the data object" [@benson_method_1998, 2:55].

!["Concatenated control data and AVI file in memory"
[@benson_method_1998].](images/avi-control.png)

!["Concatenated and encrypted control data and AVI file in memory"
[@benson_method_1998].](images/avi-control2.png)

The associated schematics (pictured here) show data and control codes
"concatenated" into the same underlying data structure (in this case, AVI
media container format). The seemingly innocuous "text control" layer that we
saw emerge in the 1960s, used to specify formatting and visual style, is now
extended to carry mechanisms for legal policing and control, tied to specific
acts of legislation.

The idea of smart contracts entails a notable side-effect of implementation,
relevant to our discussion on surface reading. To the extent that control
codes are legible to the interpreter, they are also open to "abuse and
circumvention." For this reason, encryption plays a key part in the smart
contracts system. Data and control structures embedded into modern documents
are encoded in such a way as to prevent "unauthorized access." The reader
is by these means able to access the encrypted information only through
sanctioned means. Any mode of access other than the official is deemed
illicit. Encryption brings us to the glaring problem at the heart of smart
contracts. The spirit of contractual law by its nature demands explicit
consent. In the language of English common law, contracts involve promises as
"manifestation of intention," which "adopt an external or objective standard
for interpreting conduct [@american_law_institute_restatement_1973, §1-2.]"
The key words in this passage are "external," "objective," and
"interpretation." By contrast, smart contracts, as described in the patent
archive, must rely on encrypted---that is, not human-legible---forms of tacit
compliance: neither external, objective, nor available for interpretation. The
idea of encrypted consent stands in stark opposition to a tradition of
contract law---and textual interpretation more generally---that relies on
models of comprehension and consent that involve expressed, mutual, explicit,
and uncoerced forms of acquiescence. Even if smart contracts were to be
accompanied by legible documents, written in plain text---as Terms of Service,
for example---the reader of an electronic book would be compelled to blindly
trust in the correspondence between the expressed letter and the implicit
mechanism. The contract is meaningless if its implementation is enacted beyond
scrutiny, in the form of hidden, encrypted, and purposefully illegible
scripts.

Moreover, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) stipulates that "no
person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls
access to a work protected under this title (17.1201.a.1.A)." The letter of
the law further specifies that to "circumvent a technological measure," in
this case, means "to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted
work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a
technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner
(17.1201.a.3.A)." A technological measure that "effectively controls access"
is further defined as a measure that "in the ordinary course of its operation,
requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the
authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work (17.1201.a.3.B)."
For a literary scholar, that means that, when encountering a text on a digital
device, reading sometimes *must* limit itself to surface phenomena. An attempt
at reading for depth---to discover the implemented terms of a smart contract,
for example---may carry a penalty, censure, and reprobation.[^ln3-fairuse]

The short history of DMCA "anti-circumvention" provisions is already littered
with ambiguous case law, which the Electronic Frontiers Foundation believes to
have the effect of "stifling a wide range of legitimate activities," "chilling
free expression and academic research," "jeopardizing fair use," and "impeding
innovation [@von_lohmann_unintended_2010]." Several incidents stand out as
particularly relevant to the study of literature. In one, a security
researcher exploring the activity of censorship filters on public library
computers was threatened and forced to seek DMCA exemption from the Librarian
of Congress [@fry_circumventing_2009]. In another, a Russian programmer
speaking at a security conference was jailed and detained for several months
for developing software that converts Adobe electronic book files into `.pdf`
format, in a process that could potentially remove embedded digital rights
management protections [@ferullo_major_2004; @mueller_reinventing_2004;
@postigo_information_2010]. Finally, in 2005 Agfa Monotype Corporation took
Adobe Systems to court in a dispute over the Adobe Acrobat "Free Text" tool,
which allowed users to "change text annotations using Plaintiff's TrueType
fonts" without a license [@_agfa_2005; @lipton_c_2009;
@von_lohmann_unintended_2010]. The precedent of these cases could
theoretically be used to physically limit the efficacy of reading digital
texts. Readers and literary scholars could soon find themselves prohibited
from studying the dynamics of censorship, prevented from using computational
methods that rely on text mining, and unable to extract the fruits of their
philological activity from proprietary annotation platforms.

The impact of DMCA and smart contracts on the practices of reading, writing, and
literary analysis is potentially immense. In the language of the DMCA, the
electronic book is not a book at all, but a "data object," in which the modest
copyright symbol gives way to "control layers [@fischer_digital_2003]." An
essay in the *Yale Journal of Law & Technology* explains it this way:

> While e-books and their print counterparts embody essentially identical
> content, from a transactional standpoint they differ considerably. Books are
> tangible goods that can be owned, sold, and passed on without express
> limitation--the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) governs their sale, while
> copyright law protects their content. But despite appearances, Kindle e-books
> are not, according to Amazon, sold at all: they are distributed under
> restrictive license terms, similar to downloaded software
[@seringhaus_e-book_2010, 150].

In these conditions, literature is forced to relinquish its ontological status
of the indeterminate. The DMCA attempts to arrest the movement of texts
between their concrete and universal manifestations. Reified into a concrete
object the book becomes a device, no longer lasting and transcendent, but
rather immanent and contingent, firmly determined by its instrumental
affordances. The literary device adapts itself to the situation, "to the needs
of both the owner and the user," by logics that we are not allowed to see.  We
could imagine such adaptations taking on a benign function, of the kind
suggested in "*Remix: Literatur*," where Michel Chaouli imagines a device akin
to a "literature equalizer," empowering readers to "tune" any given text to
their liking [@chaouli_remix_2009]. Don't really like intensifiers? Just turn
the "adverb knob" down! I hold on to the possibility of building such a device
with Chaouli. Meanwhile, existing electronic book software and hardware
devices adapt themselves to the reader in less creative ways. Some prevent
simple copy and paste actions. Others can be used to censor and surveil.

For a textual critic, such instability of medium means analysis cannot be
confined to reading for surface meaning alone. How can close or distant
reading practices persist, when the reading device reconfigures a text
dynamically, to fit individual taste, mood, or politics?[^ln3-modern] Or, when
it simply prevents access to some of the content? Formats shape the very
structure of interpretation. The seemingly innocuous control and formatting
layer contains the essence of machine control. Long a marginal concept in
literary theory, formatting is therefore central to the contemporary practice
of computational poetics. Far from mere inconsequential embellishment, formats
govern the interface between meaning and matter, thought and page. They have
the capability to embellish, obscure, censor, sanction, discipline, and
control.

our general thoughts are apt to be confused---but one particular body: this
piece of wax, for example. It has just been taken from the honeycomb; it still
tastes of honey and has the scent of the flowers from which the honey was
gathered; its color, shape and size are plain to see; it is hard, cold and can
be handled easily; if you rap it with your knuckle it makes a sound. In short,
it has everything that seems to be needed for a body to be known perfectly
clearly. But as I speak these words I hold the wax near to the fire, and look!
The taste and smell vanish, the color changes, the shape is lost, the size
increases; the wax becomes liquid and hot; you can hardly touch it, and it no
longer makes a sound when you strike it. But is it still the same wax? Of
course it is; no one denies this. So what was it about the wax that I
understood so clearly? Evidently it was not any of the features that the senses
told me of; for all of them---brought to me through taste, smell, sight, touch
or hearing---have now altered, yet it is still the same wax."

Principle Researcher at Microsoft Research and then a professor at the
University of Michigan. Hasslacher's essay entitled "Beyond the Turing Machine"
appeared in the same volume of collected essays, @herken_universal_1988.

[^ln3-bottom]: For example, in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of
communication, the top-most layer of protocols and interface method is called
the "application layer" and the bottom-most layer the "physical layer"
[@peterson_computer_2007, 26-28]. Timothy Colburn and Gary Shute describe it as
being "responsible for encoding bits onto a transmission medium, whether wires,
fiber optics, or radio broadcast, in ways that maximize the transmission rate
and minimize sensitivity to noise [@colburn_abstraction_2007, 181].

[^ln3-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
matter, what we regard as computer instructions, and consequently what we
regard as computer programs, is determined by computers available," he writes
[@moor_three_1978, 215]. Nurbay Irmark argues that software is instead a purely
abstract artifact, akin to a musical work [@irmak_software_2012]. See also
@turner_programming_2013; @colburn_software_1999.

[^ln3-turing]: The intellectual history of the Turing machine is well
established, in multiple works on the subject. It follows the Greek Diophantus,
René Descartes, Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell,
Kurt Gödel, Ludwig Wittgenstein [@petzold_annotated_2008;
@herken_universal_1988; @grattan-guinness_development_1981].

[^ln3-alt]: "We have to think (in a completely novel way) the relation between
a science and the ideology [...] the fact that such an investigation confronts
us with the observation that every science, in the relationship it has with
ideology it emerged from, can only be thought as a 'science of ideology, would
disconcert us, were we not forewarned of the name of the *object* of knowledge,
which can only exist in the form of ideology" [@althusser_reproduction_2014,
46].

[^ln3-derr]: See @derrida_writing_1978. I am alluding particularly to
statements like "ethnology-like any science-comes about within the element of
discourse," and "this moment was that in which language invaded the universal
problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything
became discourse-provided we can agree on this word-that is to say, when
everything became a system where the central signified, the original or
transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of
differences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and
the interplay of signification ad infinitum" (278-294).

[^ln3-flip]: There is a long-standing joke in Marxist literature that involves
flipping Hegel, who prioritized the transcendent spiritual over the physical
and material forms of life, over "back to his feet." See for example
@marx_marx-engels_1978: "The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making
a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common,
every-day thing, wood. But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is
changes into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feed on the
ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and
evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than
'table-turning' ever was" (320). See also @engels_ludwig_1941: "Thereby the
dialectic of the concept itself became merely the conscious reflex of the
dialectical motion of the real world and the dialectic of Hegel was placed
upon its head; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing
before, and placed on its feet again" (44).p5

[^ln3-domlayer]: The DOM technically exists at the application layer of the OSI
model.

[^ln3-w3c]: The International Standards Organization (ISO) in the case of OSI,
the Internet Engineering Task Force in the case of TCP/IP, and the World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C) in the case of the DOM.
