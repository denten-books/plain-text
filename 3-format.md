## Chapter 3: Form, Formula, Format

Text shapes the human body in strange ways. After a lifetime of reading
shoulders acquire a stooped countenance, as if the book was exerting pressure
against the solar plexus. Eyesight deteriorates through continual exertion.
Tendons and other supporting structures in the wrist swell from the repetitive
stress of striking keys, working against the resistance of the mechanical
letter. Reading and writing take their toll. A further profound change happens
when we read and write along with the machine. We read and interpret
electronic literary devices, while the electronic literary devices are reading
and interpreting us. Machine learning algorithms track the speed by which
readers advance from paragraph to paragraph, creating a "fingerprint" that
points to markers of gender, age, race, ethnicity, and economic status.
Algorithmic agents follow the movement of the eye and the finger to anticipate
what the reader is likely to be interested in next and to understand how the
human brain makes connections between topics. Heat maps are drawn to reflect
the dynamics of boredom, fatigue, focus, attention, and desire. Supervised
training algorithms use our collective philological output---tagging and
commenting---to learn how to sort information autonomously and to curate
content that better suits our predilections. Deep neural networks artificially
mimic the brain to build models of human behavior. These models are
notoriously difficult to interpret, as they are not meant for human
comprehension [@andrews_survey_1995; @karim_x-trepan:_2015]. A vast archive of
literature by machines and for machines thus supports the corpus of
human-readable texts.

Despite its formative impact on the practices of comprehension, code---the
programmatic sign---does not often figure in our theories of meaning making.
Instead, we erroneously consign it to the ornamental "formatting" layer of
document structure. We do so at our peril. Unlike passive decorative elements
like fleurons, daggers and pilcrows, box drawings, and other dingbats the
programmatic sign actively molds text to context. At the maximally blunt limit
of its capabilities, format governs access. For example, a command can
selectively render some words and sentences visible on the screen while
suppressing others. The ability to hide text from view completely or to make
it so small as to be illegible affects not just the style but the politics of
text. Code, in that sense, can determine its audience, privileging certain
voices and modes of reading over others. It is in the sense of audience
selection that the programmatic sign acquires its non-representational,
tactical character. Stripped of references, resemblances, and designations the
programmatic sign commands and controls.[^ln3-bdrld]

[^ln3-bdrld]: Recall the Baudrillard quote from the beginning of the last
chapter [@baudrillard_simulacra_1994, 139-40].

Unlike figurative language, machine control languages function in the
imperative. They do not stand for action---they are action. More binding than
the "speech acts" J.L. Austin, control codes arrange and regulate. Code is an
exercise of power, not its representation. The difference between
representation and control is one of brute force. It lies in the distinction
between a restraining order and physical restraint. A restraining order
*signifies* the calling forth of codified power. Physical restraints like
handcuffs *enact* the exercise of codified power. Like all violence they do
not stand for anything. The handcuffs simply contort the body into the shape
of submission. Absent a body, the restraints draw an empty shape.

Code acts similarly to shape the word. Located somewhere between the screen
and the storage medium, formats relate matter to content. They are techniques
by which an immanent inscription is transformed into a transcendent digital
object: a novel, song, film, or poem. Formatting imposes structure. Think of a
paragraph, for example. By convention, writers use paragraphs to break up the
flow of monolithic thought on a page. The paragraph contains information. Can
one imagine an empty paragraph? Could the shape of a paragraph persist outside
of the material confines of a page or screen? Can one imagine paragraphs that
unfold spatially not in two dimensions, but in one, along a straight line?
What about a structure of words and sentences that extend into the third
dimension: the paragraph in the shape of a cube, instead of a rectangle? These
questions boggle the mind because paragraphs draw a singular figure. They are
a textual container of a type. Any other shape less or more than the paragraph
would go by another name; it would constitute another format. To imagine
something like a one-dimensional paragraph is akin to imagining a flat
shoebox. A flat shoebox would no longer house shoes. It could contain only the
images of footwear. A paragraph identifies a similarly singular arrangement of
elements. It is a container or a data structure of a kind, made to hold a
certain amount of words and sentences. We may liken paragraphs, words, and
sentences to nesting dolls: data structures that contain within them further,
smaller arrangements of information. A word fits inside of a sentence, the
sentence within a paragraph, the paragraph within a chapter, the chapter
within a book, the book within an archive, and so on. One could say, what of
such arrangements?  Who cares about paragraphs? It is merely one type of a
container among many. It has only the instrumental function to help get the
point across. The meat of interpretation lies within.  Words can also be
packaged otherwise. The outer container is disposable and therefore
insignificant.

Formats could only seem insignificant in the past when they were few, simple,
and relatively consistent. The book or the broadsheet newspaper are known
entities: we understand how they are made and how to unfold them in space.
Composite computational formats change rapidly and proliferate. They contain
further, as yet unexplored structural possibilities: shapes like the paragraph
on paper, but native to new media. What you saw is what you got on the page.
On the screen, what you see is but a small part of what you could get. We are
presented with *thick content*---all that is contained within the
three-dimensional page, not just the visible image. In print, content can be
gleaned from the surface; there is nothing but surface on a page. The screen
is a layered composite. Light and liquid crystal---the preferred media for
contemporary text---surge between the substrates in response to electrical
signal. Screen surfaces conceal further strata of codification, inscribed onto
recondite planes of inscription: hard disks, solid state drives, platters,
drums, memory sticks, layers of oxide. A byte, made up of eight binary bits,
holds a letter. The string of letters spelling out "hello world" occupies
eleven bytes on the hard drive.[^ln3-space] A file in the Portable Document
Format (`.pdf`) containing nothing but "hello world" takes up 24,335 bytes on
my system. Thick content accounts for the disparity between plain text and
fancy text, the latter defined as "text representation consisting of plain
text plus added information" [@unicode_consortium_unicode_1990].

[^ln3-space]: Ten bytes for the letters and one byte for the space character.

What is the nature of this "added information?" Historically, added
information included machine instructions for the viewing and printing of text
along with cypher codes used for clandestine communication. The common
Portable Document Format (PDF) contains features that enable--and I quote the
exact specifications here---"accessibility of content to those with
disabilities," "digital signatures to certify authenticity," "electronic forms
to gather data," "preservation of document fidelity independent of the device,
platform, and software," and "security and permission to allow the creator to
retain control of the document and associated rights" [@iso_portable_2008,
vii]. These capabilities mediate between visible image and stored information:
one surface facing the human, the other, the machine. The formatting layer
specifies the *affordances* of electronic text. More than passive conduits of
meaning, electronic texts thus carry within them rules for engagement between
authors, readers, and devices. In our example, the Portable Document Format
encodes among other things ideas about "reading," "authenticity," "fidelity,"
"preservation," and "authorship." Whatever literary-theoretical framework the
reader brings to the process of interpretation must therefore meet the
affordances encoded into the electronic text itself. Such an encounter happens
not on the level of representation or ideology, but on the level of the
physical, the phatic, and the imperative, where formatting and control codes
reside.

In this chapter I would like to move us towards the systematic study of
format. The familiar paper paragraph structure already presents several
interesting problems for analysis. In claiming typographical space on a page
the paragraph suggests corresponding mental units. A unit of text becomes also
a unit of thought. But no such structures as paragraphs exist in the mind.
Physiologically, the brain arranges information hexagonally, along the
entorhinal grid.[^ln3-hex]

![Forms and formats.](images/forms.png)

Just like there is nothing inherently paragraph-like in the neural arrangement
of the brain, there is also nothing inherently paragraph-like or page-like in
the arrangement of bits along the surface of the magnetic disk or the solid
state drive. If we could peek inside the machine, we would see forms and
structures particular to those media. The back of the traditional paragraph
form faces the paper. Things get significantly more complicated when the same
rectangular shape begins to mediate between the mind and the page on the one
side of comprehension, and the page and the machine on the other. The analysis
of computational forms requires new formalisms and new critical vocabularies
capable of drawing correspondences between disparate systems of ordering and
signification. We are at the moment presented with metaphors of order:
paragraphs, pages, files, and folders. Images of such ordering structures on
the screen look like their paper counterparts, but they represent other, less
familiar ordering structures on the disk. These two ways of ordering are not
equivalent to each other. They imply differing possibilities and affordances.

Formats mediate between data structures, transforming one into the other
according to a predefined set of rules. The screen projection---content
arranged on the screen---represents a mental image---information stored in the
head---becomes inscription---information stored in the machine. The complexity
of the interface between these disparate symbolisms stems from the fundamental
incompatibility between incommensurate physicalities. Format specifications
govern the transference of data structures from one medium into the other, at
the point of contact between human, symbol, and machine.

[^ln3-symbolisms]: I am interlacing language from Wittgenstein and Alexander
Galloway. On disparate symbolisms see @wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 45.
On incommensurate physicalities see @galloway_interface_2012, viii.

Formatting rules facilitate the conversion of machine-readable codes into
human-readable text. The structure of the transformation governs the
production, storage, reception, and the dissemination of the textual artifact.
Despite its significance, formatting continues to elude the critical gaze
because our very concept of form, central to literary analysis, has always
drifted between vague and conflicting intuitions. The history of formalism, as
I will outline it in the first part of this chapter, contains within it at
least these two conflicting ideas about the nature of literary form. Going
back to the reception of Plato, Hegel, and the Russian formalists, the English
"form" renders at times the material, outward, and apparent shape of something
said, written, or pictured. Yet just as often, critics use "form" in the sense
of a Platonic ideal: abstracted from matter, inward-facing, and in need of
explication. Form in that sense is closer to the idea of an algorithm of a
formula: it signifies according to implicit rules.

In this chapter, I would like to augment these two senses of form with a
third, introducing the concept of format into the critical discourse. The
intellectual history of form in literary theory will meet the material history
of formatting in computer science in the second half of the chapter. A
historically-grounded theoretical discussion about formalism will lead us to
the formal structure at the heart of every digital document and finally to the
notion of a smart document, capable of activity policing the encoded rules of
engagement: what can be read, how, and where. In the process, we will observe
formats develop from simple machine instructions for typographical layout to
complex political directives pertaining to intellectual property rights,
constraints on speech, trade agreements, secrecy, and national security.

### 3.1 Concrete and Universal

The intellectual history of formalist thought in literary theory contains
within it at least these two distinct and contradictory ideas about form: one
about the outward shape of the sign and another about the inward structure or
formula that governs semiosis. The distinction is important because it leads
to several conflicting strategies of interpretation. Taken in the sense of
"outward shape," form suggests an aesthetics or even an "erotics" of art
[@sontag_against_1966]. In this view, a sign is forever embedded into the
specific contexts of inscription, and alternatively, in the contexts of its
reception. The material peculiarity of a word makes it forever different from
the same word on a different page.  Formalism in this sense is concerned with
the palpable, outward physical attributes of text. Understood as formula, form
suggests a more analytical approach, aimed at explicating the inward
structures---rules, patterns, archetypes---that shape the production of text
from within. Formal analysis in that sense studies not specific traces or
utterances, but rather the development of ideal forms, which exist independent
of any specific instantiation. Form in that sense constitutes an abstraction,
leading to generalized historical categories like genre and period. Our ideas
about "the novel," for example, or "modernism," or "post-colonial theory"
reflect formal groupings of that kind. Where palpable form leads to immanent
material artifacts, the abstracted notion of form leads to transcendent,
universal ideals.

The notion of a "format" occupies the conceptual space somewhere between form
as intrinsic formula and form as extrinsic shape. In what remains a singular
article-length treatment on the topic in literary studies, G. Thomas Tanselle
approaches the concept of formatting from the point of view of textual
criticism---the practice of compiling, editing, annotating, preserving, and
publishing scholarly critical editions of (often) canonical texts. For
Tanselle's purposes, the concept of formatting addresses narrowly something
like "the number of page units placed on the press at one time"
[@tanselle_concept_2000, 112-3]. He acknowledges, however, that more broadly
speaking, formats refer also to the "nature and the order of the contents"
[@tanselle_concept_2000, 67-8]. In this way, soap operas seem a format for
daytime television. The format of a journal may be a "broadsheet daily" or a
"tabloid." Unlike the more narrow term, genre, format identifies both a
particular kind and a particular structuring of content. The novel is a genre,
where the paperback is its common format. A paperback implies not only the
physical shape of the book, but also a method of manufacturing and
distribution, along with the *kind* of content. We do not expect scientific
textbooks in paperback, for example, just as we would not expect tabloids to
be printed on expensive stock or to support long-form investigative
journalism. The format captures something about the shape, the design, the
style, and the thematics of the subject matter; it connects, in other words,
the where to the what, the how, and in what order.

With these provisional definitions down on paper, I would like to revisit a
few of the canonical texts from the long history of formalism. It would be
interesting to see, for example, whether Plato's or Hegel's seminal passages
on formal aesthetics fall on inward structure or outward shape side of the
divide I have posited so far. Note first that in whatever tradition, the
concept of "form" is usually contraposed to some idea of "content." Content
refers to the stuff being shaped or arranged, whether by intrinsic law or
though extrinsic shaping. For example, the historian R.G. Collingwood famously
described the distinction between classical and romantic art periods in terms
of for the form/content divide. He wrote: "Classical art, in a word, stands
for form; romantic art for content" [@collingwood_form_1929, 335]. In recent
work on computational text generation, Kathleen McKeown wrote that to produce
discourse, writers and speakers "must decide what to say and how to present it
effectively," once again making the distinction content (the what to say) and
its presentation. McKeown writes that a machine that generates text should,
among other things, be able to determine the "content and textual shape" of
what needs to be said or written [@mckeown_text_1992, 1]. Similarly, in her
influential essay "Print Is Flat, Code Is Deep," Katherine Hayles writes about
"the interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying
strategies" [@hayles_print_2004, 72]. In this way, a text having differing
physical characteristics may nevertheless employ the same signifying
strategies. The various editions of Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, for example, may
look different but nevertheless refer to the same work of art. We saw a
similar distinction in the discussion about technique, where writers made a
distinction between the object of art, a transcendent idea or content of the
work, and the object itself which contained the work's immanent, physical
characteristics.

As an aside, note that what counts for material belonging to the contingent
physical characteristics of a text object and what counts for the material
belonging to its signifying strategies depends on the kind of object at hand.
In this way, when reading a novel the reader may ignore the line length. The
length of an average line in Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*, for example,
changes with the edition. In this case, line lengths carry no meaning. But
when reading poetry, for example, the reader understands line length to be an
integral part of the text's "signifying strategies." The distinction between
form and content in that sense propagates a kind of value formation, by which
we are asked to separate those attributes of the texts that are meaningful
from those that are not. Some notion of form in that distinction implies
disposable shape, asking us to identify those physical attributes of the text
that can be omitted in the interpretation or the reproduction of texts. One
can imagine a printer deciding to discard information about the color of a
manuscript's ink for example or to do way with the idiosyncrasies of a
writer's handwriting. Those parts of the texts that are deemed insignificant
are omitted, while those dimmed significant pass from the category of
contingent "formal" characteristics to its essential signifying "contents."

The traditional distinction between form and content helps us perceive yet
another sense of "form," by which theorists often identify quite the opposite
to what is meant by form in the sense of a disposable shape. Consider that
under traditional, Platonic definitions form denotes the essential properties
of the object. For Plato, the "essence" or an "idea" of something (like a
chair) exists in an ideal, metaphysical state, somewhere beyond the confines
of the material universe. By contrast, a physical instantiation of that object
(a specific chair) embodies a somewhat more limited, corrupted even, version
of that perfect idea. The task of the philosopher becomes one of
reconstructing the single ideal notion of the perfect chair from its many
imperfect instantiations. A computer scientist will recognize in this chain of
reasoning some of the principles behind object-oriented programming: a way of
building software that works by defining abstract "object classes" and
invoking them as "class instances" [@hoare_record_1965;
@nygaard_history_1981]. The abstract class can further be modified, or
extended when called into action. In this way the abstract category of chairs
becomes a given chair, complete with individual flaws and imperfections. As
before, the flaws an imperfections are considered insignificant compared to
the perfected form of the ideal chair. In the idealist tradition, ideas
provide us with lasting universal "templates" for instantiation within the
contingent and always changing physical confines of the material
world.[^ln4-descartes]

So far, I have been using the term "form" quite liberally, relying on the
reader's intuitions about its use in everyday language. A closer look at the
canonical texts in the original will help us identify the conflicting meanings
that emerge in translation. In Plato's dialogues we find a number of words
that are sometimes reasonably rendered into the English "form." These include
*eidos* (essence), *idea* (idea), *morphe* (shape), and *phainomena*
(appearance). Compare, for example, the following several translations from
Plato's *Timaeus*. In *Timaeus*, we see the titular character discuss the
nature of the physical world with his collocutor. In a passage that
anticipates the famous "molten wax" analogy in Descartes, Timaeus notices that
some elements, like water, change their appearance [*phantazomenōn*] while
remaining essentially the same substance. Benjamin Jowett translates the
passage as follows:

> Thus, then, as the several elements never present themselves in the same
> form [*phantazomenōn*], how can anyone have the assurance to assert
> positively that any of them, whatever it may be, is one thing rather than
> another?  [@plato_timaeus_1998, 49d]

Compare the above with the translation of the same passage by W.R.M. Lamb, who
renders the Greek *phantazomenōn* into the English "appearance":

> Accordingly, since no one of these ever remains identical in appearance
> [*phantazomenōn*], which of them shall a man definitely affirm to be any one
> particular element and no other without incurring ridicule?
> [@plato_plato_1955, 48d]

Both translations of the Greek *phantazomenōn*, form and appearance, capture
the plain meaning of the passage: the essence of a thing remains even as its
outward appearance changes, taking on a phantasmal, fantastic, ghostly,
imaginable, and even "virtual" shape and appearance (all reasonable English
approximations of the Greek *phantazomenōn*). Accordingly, Jowett translates
*phantazomenōn* (that which is changeable) as "form" and Lamb as "appearance."

Contrast the *Timaeus* passages with the ones in *Cratylus*, about
name-giving. In *Cratylus*, Socrates and Hermogenes discuss the ways in which
words signify things by convention. "What has the carpenter in view when he
makes a shuttle?" Socrates asks. "Is it not something the nature of which is
to weave?" Hermogenes answers. "Well, then, if the shuttle breaks while he is
making it, will he make another with his mind fixed on that which is broken,
or on that form [*eidos*] with reference to which he was making the one which
he broke?" Hermogenes agrees the carpenter would fix his mind on the ideal
form. In that case, we should properly call *that* the real shuttle, Socrates
concludes---his point being that the exact outward appearance of individual
shuttles does not matter as much as the abstracted idea of shuttles. The
abstraction endures even as given instantiations break and shatter. There
exist different types of shuttles, some used to weave wool and some for linen,
but all of them, in Jowett's translation, "must contain the form or ideal
[*eidos*] of shuttle" [@plato_dialogues_1937, 389a-b]. In *Cratylus*, *eidos*
or form stands for the "universal lasting ideal" of all shuttles: exactly the
opposite of *phantazomenōn* as "ephemeral instantiation" in the previous
passage! Yet both *eidos* and *phantazomenōn* were reasonably translated into
the English "form," indicating a fundamental overloading of the
concept.[^ln4-plato]

The confusion persists in many English translations of G.W.F. Hegel, whose
discussion of Platonic forms gives us another paradigmatic text in the history
of formal aesthetics. In his *Lectures on Aesthetics*, Hegel posits classical
art as striving to reach an equilibrium between its ideational, spiritual
content and "the configuration of sensuous material" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 70].
Hegel prose is marked by technical and sometimes idiosyncratic vocabulary.
Rather than define terms precisely, Hegel saturates his text with semantic
cognates. On the side of "content" [*Inhalt*, *Gehalt*], he evokes words like
inner life [*Innere Lebendigkeit*], feeling [*Empfindung*], soul [*Seele*],
and spirit [*Geist*]. All of these convey a movement inward to a location (if
it can be called such) beyond the physical world, accessible only to the
spirit [*Geist*] or mind [*Gedanken*, *Verstand*]. On the side of "form" (same
in German), Hegel accumulates words like expression [*Ausdruck*] and
presentation [*Darstellung*], but also lines, curves, surfaces, carvings,
colors, tones, word sounds, and generally matter or material [*Linien*,
*Krümmungen*, *Flächen*, *Aushöhlungen*, *Farben*, *Tönen*, *Wortklängen*,
*Material*] [@hegel_werke:_1986, *Einleitung*]. The semantic cluster of words
related to "form" conveys physical (palpable, of this world) and
outward-facing properties, available for examination to the senses (*Sinne*).

In contrasting the dominant aesthetic modes of classical and Romantic periods,
Hegel paints Romanticism as an art that seeks to disengage itself from matter,
reaching the realm of pure self-reflective Spirit. Romanticism, in his words,
is "freed from this immediate existence which must be set down as negative,
overcome, and reflected into the spiritual unity" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 81]. He
writes: "Poetry is the universal art of the spirit which has become free in
itself and which is not tied down for its realization to external sensuous
material; instead, it launches out exclusively in the inner space and the
inner time of ideas and feelings" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 89]. Finally,
"inwardness celebrates its triumph over the external and manifests its victory
in and on the external itself, whereby what is apparent to the senses alone
sinks into worthlessness" [@hegel_hegels_1998, 81]. Romantic art can, in this
way, triumph over the external, material world, reaching, at its apex, what he
calls the stage of "free concrete spirituality" [*freie konkrete Geistigkeit*]
[@hegel_werke:_1986]. The idea overcomes matter to become both free from the
constraints of the deterministic physical universe, yet gaining a measure of
solidity in its tangible instantiation.

Several lines in Hegel's own exposition on Plato's idealism give us a glimpse
of his struggle with the Platonic concept of form. In his "Lectures on
Philosophy," Hegel writes: "The Idea is nothing but what is current with us
under the name of the Universal, when this word is not taken in the sense of
*formal* Universal [*formell Allgemeine*]." The formal universal for him is
"merely a property of things," whereas Plato is concerned with the
"implicitly" universal (as contrasted with explicitly, or formally universal).
This internal "essence" and "in-and-for-itself existent" lays a claim to truth
alone. Hegel writes: "We translate the Greek word *eidos* by 'genus' or
'species,'" but when "genus" or "species" are "seized as a number of similar
determinations collected by reflection from several individuals, to serve as a
*mark* for the convenience of the understanding, then we have the Universal in
quite an external form" [@hegel_philosophy_1870, 250]. In other words, as soon
as *eidos* is instantiated, it moves from being an ideal form into an apparent
shape, as an epistemological category.

I understand Hegel's problem with "formal Universal" as follows. Imagine
someone were to write "all these cats are subsumed under the category of
'feline.'" The ideal of being "feline" captures a snapshot of what it means to
be feline at the moment of the category's naming. For Hegel, the true ideal
cannot exist in the name alone, it must continue to exist and develop in the
real world. It is not, in other words, merely a socially constructed (we would
say today) category, but something that "internally distinguishes itself"
while remaining "free in its infinitude and independent" from all attempts to
fix it categorically. The best I can understand this is to think about the
evolutionary process that continues in the species, even as the taxonomy
describing that evolution may remain tied to its fixed ways of expression. No
matter what we call cats, the feline species will continue to evolve. New and
radically different cats may come into existence---ones no longer covered by
the "external mark" of being "feline," that is by our taxonomical categories.
Yet this would only mean that the ideal of "feline" has developed past human
understanding. Zoologists would, at that point, need simply adjust their
categories to include new forms of feline being. Ideal feline being moves on
immediately thereafter, continuing to develop and leaving behind only the husk
or a "snapshot" of what it meant to be a cat in times already past. For Hegel,
one should not confuse that static categorical snapshot with the animate
ideal. For this reason Hegel disparages the "formal universal" as a corrupted,
"mere" form of the ideal.

By contrast to the "formal universal," Hegel's "concrete universal" exists in
the real, physical world. It is more than a category. One way to understand
this difficult concept is to think of it as capturing both *eidos* and
*phantazomenōn*---or idea and appearance, both reasonably transcribed to
"form" in English. In an essay on Hegel's concept, John Crowe Ransom likens it
to a "little universe or an organized working combination of parts." He
writes: "Thus the formula of a chemical reaction; the recipe for a dish; the
blue-print of a machine." Crucially, the Hegelian universal becomes concrete
when the machine "has been materialized, and working properly"
[@ransom_concrete_1954, 387]. As was the case with Wittgenstein's logical
mechanisms, Ransom imagines a perfected kind of a machine that represents the
ideal of the aesthetic object.

### 3.2 Strategies of Reading

The above notes on Plato and Hegel are not meant to present a definitive
history of formalism in Western aesthetics. Rather, they point to series of
related folds and creases in that tradition, appearing around the concept of
form with some regularity. W.K. Wimsatt once observed that literary theorists
often persist in making statements that understand a work of literary art to
be, in a peculiar way, "a very individual thing or a very universal thing or
both" [@wimsatt_structure_1947, 262]. A work of art, a poem, understood as
something which "cannot be expressed in other terms" leads to the kind of
criticism that emphasizes the reflection upon the outward, affective, palpable
elements of the text. The function of such criticism, according to Wimsatt, is
to create "approximate descriptions of poems" and "multiple restatements of
their meaning," which aid the reader in coming to their own "intuitive and
full realizations" of literature [@wimsatt_structure_1947, 280]. Understood as
an end product of a living ideal or formula, the analysis of literature seeks
to recover latent universal mechanisms, laws, and deep structures that give
rise to surface phenomena.

The dual motion of literary criticism at once towards the outward shape and
inward formula---poetics and hermeneutics---is perhaps most starkly visible in
the intellectual legacy of Russian formalism in the first few decades of 20th
century. The seminal series of "OPOYAZ" publications, appearing between 1916
and 1920, gave voice to a unified program to a group of literary scholars that
included Viktor Shklovsky, Osip Brik, Lev Yakubinsky, Boris Eichenbaum, and
Roman Jakobson, among others. Collectively, the volumes strike out in two
distinct, but complementary directions.

A set of essays by Brik, Shklovsky, Yakubinski, and others contrapose "sound"
[*zvuk*] to "symbol" [*obraz*]. Brik writes: "I believe that elements of
symbolic and sonic [*zvukovoi*] art exist simultaneously, and that every given
piece of [poetic] work comprises an equilibrium of these two heterogeneous
poetic impulses" [@shklovksy_sborniki_1917, 25]. Of the sixteen or so unique
essays that appear in the three collected volumes (some of the essays repeat
across volumes), thirteen have the word "sound" [*zvuk*], or some variation
thereof, in the title, in combinations like "sound image," "sound gesture,"
and "sound repetition." To this cluster of essays we may attribute the Russian
formalist concern with *zaum*---literally, beyond sense, or beyonsense---
trans-rational, nonsensical sounds that nevertheless elicit an affective,
lived response, giving voice to ideas that are difficult to explain rationally
[@khlebnivkov_collected_1987, 179; @khlebnikov_king_1990, 151;
@labelle_lexicon_2014, 63].

Poetry in the symbolic mode encodes meaning inwardly: the elephant "stands
for" memory, or the like. *Zaum* poetics instead evoke affect through external
shape, as sound. Khlebnikov writes that "mystical incantation and beyonsense
are appeals 'over the head' of government straight to the population of
feelings, a direct cry to the predawn of the soul" [@khlebnikov_king_1990,
152]. Shklovsky defines *zaum* as "without words but with sound." He writes:

> Thought and speech cannot keep up with inspired experience, and
for this reason artists are free to express themselves not only in language of
common understanding, but also in private language---language that has no
settled sense [...] Lilacs are beautiful, but how deformed [*bezobrazno*] the
word "lilac," plundered and exhausted. This is why I call a lilac "uao,"
restoring its primal clarity [@shklovksy_poetika_1919, 13].

The word *bezobrazno*, in the meaning of hideous or deformed, literally
translates as "without an image." In language of lilacs has lost its shape,
the author implies. Formalism of the outward kind thus aims to restore the
word image, returning form, in the sense of shape, to content. Formal
techniques like chanting or neologism revitalize the external sound image. In
repetition the word loses its sense while gaining a distinct physical sound
signature, which habitually goes unnoticed in everyday use.

Three of the sixteen essays in the seminal volumes I have discussed above
strike in another direction, away from shape and towards formula. Shklovsky's
"Art as Technique," "Linkages between Plot and Style Device," and Eichenbaum's
"How the *Overcoat* Is Made," constitute a cluster of essays that deal with
narrative structure rather than phonetic image.[ln3-propp]  All three authors
cite a common source of influence for this direction of research: namely, the
work of Alexander Veselovsky, the 19th century Russian historian of literature
and founder of the comparative method in that tradition. Veselovsky, a scholar
of the generation previous to the formalists, did not attain the renown
enjoyed by his pupils in the West. An early pioneer of comparative literature,
he advocated philology as a "historical" and "genetic" study of "poetic
consciousness and its forms." Citing literary explorations by Goethe,
Friedrich Schiller, and Georges Polti as his inspiration, Veselovsky almost
always uses the word "form" in the sense of the "formula," and not at all in
the sense of "shape" or "sound." In this, he imagines a rather Hegelian model
of literary evolution, which proceeds through the development of universal
constants, narrative plot sequences for example, which further influence the
development of literary particulars.  Veselovsky calls these genetic constants
"vagabond formulas" [@veselovsky_sobranie_1913, 185]. He writes:

> Somewhere, someone gave these plots [*siuzhety*] an apt expression, a
> formula, elastic enough to fit, if not new content, then new interpretations
> of plots rich in their associative possibilities. The formula endures.
> Writers will return to it, altering its significance, expanding its meaning,
> and adopting it to new types. As the formula of "desire" was and continues
> to be repeated, so also are repeated the plots of *Faust* and *Don Juan*
> across the distance of centuries [...] We are connected to a tradition. We
> expand within it---not to create new forms, but to attach to them new
> sentiments and concerns. This dynamic could be considered as a type of "law
> of [cultural] energy conservation. [@veselovsky_sobranie_1913, 475-47]

[ln3-propp]: To this strain of formalism one could also adduce Vladimir
Propp's well-known *Morphology of the Folktale*, a text that finds a limited
number of universal principles of composition in the multiplicity of folktale
traditions.

The Hegelian influence is unmistakable in these lines. Like the world spirit,
literary formulae exist and develop across time and space. Veselovsky's
formulas resemble concrete universals, which develop independently of
individual texts. Formulae in this sense have a life of their own, in a trans-
or meta- human way, not accessible to the individual author. They are evoked
indirectly. They exist in the ether of culture, attaining a historical
momentum of their own through a process of gradual genetic development. Form,
in this Hegelian, historical sense, means exactly the opposite of form in the
sense of a private utterance, by which an individual author breaks with an
ossified tradition, as was the case with Shklovsky's idiosyncratic naming of
the flower, *uao*.

The tension between extrinsic shape and intrinsic rule lies at the heart of
literary theory, manifesting at times under differing yet essentially related
vocabularies. The emphasis on extrinsic shape logically leads to the poetics
of affective reading of the kind that privileges apparent surface phenomena.
The emphasis on intrinsic rules leads to a hermeneutics or an archeology of
text, by which the critics role becomes to discover non-apparent deep
structural regularities. Recently, the theoretical distinction between shape
and formula has been negotiated in terms of depth and surface. Two types of
reading become evident in this model. The "symptomatic" literary critic
reaches beyond the "ephemeral" external appearances to uncover internal and
eternal metaphysical truth within. For a Marxist critic like Terry Eagleton or
Frederic Jameson that latent meaning may have something to do with hidden
machinations of capital and ideology. The psychologically minded critic reads
in search of hidden drives, desires, or cognitive structures. By contrast to
symptomatic reading, Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus describe a constellation
of reading practices concerned with "what is evident, perceptible,
apprehensible in text: what is neither hidden nor hiding; what, in the
geometrical sense, has length and breadth but no thickness, and therefore
covers no depth." The authors identify a constellation of related
interpretation practices at the surface: reading for material surface, reading
for verbal structure, reading for affect, reading for description, reading for
pattern, and finally, reading for literal meaning or "just reading"
[@best_surface_2009, 9].

In making the argument for a kind of surface reading, Best and Marcus appeal
to the kind of formal poetics advocated by Susan Sontag in the late 1960s. At
the time, Sontag wrote about "the need for more attention to form in art."
Interpretation can be liberating, she wrote, but it can also stifle
creativity. It "depletes" the world in some way, placing the critic in a
privileged and unnecessarily meddling position between reader and text. "If
excessive stress on content provokes the arrogance of interpretation, more
extended and more thorough descriptions of form would silence," she writes.
"The best criticism, and it is uncommon, is of this sort that dissolves
considerations of content into those of form" [@sontag_against_1966, 8-9].
Marcus and Best remind the reader that Sontag's manifesto is not just an
argument against interpretation, but also an "affective and ethical stance"
[@best_surface_2009, 10]. Strategies of "deep" interpretation carry with them
also a claim to access, along with an imbalance of interpretive acumen. The
critic claims to uncover what the lay reader does not and cannot see without
expert guidance. As an ethical stance, reading for external forms flattens the
hierarchy between the lay reader and the professional interpreter. In this
sense, Best, Marcus, and Sontag continue in the liberal Lutheran tradition of
vernacular exegesis. All readers are priests at the surface. All readers are
capable, the critics suggest, of forming their own interpretation.

Interpretation at the level of meaning and content for Sontag is an
intellectual and ultimately reactionary activity. It aims to find "the maximum
amount of content" within. It is reactionary because it serves only to
multiply the available "levels of analysis." In explicating the work of art,
the critic essentially creates alternative and diverging copies of the
original. Each layer of criticism adds to the content of the work. In Sontag's
words, to "design" a work of art that can be experienced in this way, on
multiple levels, might have been "creative" and "revolutionary" in the age of
aesthetic paucity, when creativity and interpretation were limited to a few
privileged individuals. By contrast, Sontag believes that her times are a
period of creative abundance. "Think of the sheer multiplication of works of
art available to all of us," she writes. Contemporary culture is based on
"excess" and "material plenitude" which dull the senses. In such conditions,
the production of further critical variations on the theme only adds to the
dulling clutter.

By "interpretation," Sontag means a "conscious act of the mind" which
illustrates a "certain code," or "certain rules" of engagement. It is, for
her, "virtually" a type of translation. The critic "transforms" and "revamps"
the text: X turns out to be A, Y turns out to be B, and so on
[@sontag_against_1966, 3]. And by "form" Sontag means something like the
apparent, perceptual properties of the work: this sentence is long, for
example. And this one short. A critic could say that the sentence length means
something, but Sontag wants to stop short of meaning making. A discipline of
careful perception---of paying attention---rather sharpens the reader's
sensibilities. The history of interpretation Sontag objects to is one that
privileges content over form. The very words "explication" and "exegesis"
imply the movement from inside to the outside. For a psychoanalytical critic
interpretation in that sense may mean revealing the hidden psychological
drives that give rise to a particular form of an expression. A Marxist critic
may instead look for the concealed operation of this or that ideology.
Fredrick Jameson, a prominent Marxist critic, writes for example:

> Thus the process of criticism is, not so much the interpretation of
content, as it is a revealing of it, a laying bare, a restoration of the
original message, the original experience, beneath the distortions of the
various kinds of censorship that have been at work upon it; and this revelation
takes the form of an explanation of why the content was so distorted and is
thus inseparable from a description of the mechanisms of the censorship itself
[@jameson_marxism_1972, 404].

Form in the sense of "outward shape" suggests an emphasis on what Susan Sontag
deemed the "sensory experience" or the "erotics" of art. In her now classic
1966 essay "Against Interpretation," Sontag posits transparency as the
"highest, most liberating value in art and in criticism today." "Transparency
means experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself, of things being
what they are" she explains [@sontag_against_1966, 9]. Rather than to show
what a work of art *means*, Sontag urges critics to show "how it is" and "that
it is" [@sontag_against_1966, 10]. To make her argument Sontag relies on the
distinction between "meaning" or "content" on the one hand and "form" or the
"sensory experience" of the work on the other. Form, in this sense, mirrors
McKeown's "shape" and the "text's physical characteristics" of Hayles.

If reading for sensory experience implies an erotics of art and reading for
hidden formulae implies an analytics, what would it mean to read for the
format? To borrow from Tanselle's vocabulary, the format bridges the "physical
structure of finished books" with their "intellectual content." This
connection happens through what Tanselle calls "printing-shop routines" and
what we began to identify in the previous chapter as a kind of a technique.
Formatting in that sense is a way of structuring of information. The task of a
textual scholar broadly is therefore to serve in the role of an arbitrator in
the conflict between the textual witnesses, which individually contain
slightly differing versions of the same text, but in aggregate identify the
sum total of a given work.[^ln3-printers] The textual scholar studies how
works become texts and the other way around. It is in this sense, for example,
that C. Deirdre Phelps describes the notion of physical form in textual
criticism. In creating a physical manifestation of a text, publishers
introduce textual changes that may or may not correspond to either authorial
intention or the reader's expectations. For example, we could imagine an
expensive edition of poetry by William Blake to be printed without
illustrations to save costs. If we subsequently lose all other editions of
Blake, the textual critic may be interested in reconstructing the
bibliographic genealogy of this one edition to understand something about the
life of the work. "The textual critic is concerned mainly with the fact of the
[textual] change itself," Phelps writes [@phelps_edition_1994, 65-6].

[^ln3-printers]: See for example the discussion on the limits of the inductive
method in bibliographic study in @mckenzie_making_2002, 16-17. See also
@mcgann_socialization_1991; @tanselle_textual_1996.

Various schools of textual criticism may privilege either authorial intention,
publisher's discretion, or the reader's expectation, but whatever these
choices may hold, they propagate a kind of value determination that separates
those physical attributes meaningful to the work from those that are not. For
example, in their online edition of Claude McKay's 1922 collection of poems
*Harlem Dawn*, the editors made the decision to encode indentation, preserving
the perceived integrity of the poem's visual line structure. However, they
have also allowed for the text to wrap when viewed on small devices, in effect
"soft wrapping" those lyrical lines that are too long to fit on a small
screen. The end result is a compromise between authorial intention and
technological capability. Other solutions are possible, of course. The editors
could have chosen to recreate a graphical facsimile of a particular print
edition, which would not render well on small screen [@mckay_harlem_2015]. The
choice to preserve certain attributes of formatting, while suppressing others
identifies those elements meaningful to the editors. In the most extreme case,
we could imagine an editor wanting to preserve all of a text's details, down
to the molecular structure of the original. Such a text could be accompanied
by a potentially unlimited amount of metadata describing the precise physical
contexts of the universe surrounding the authoritative version. To reproduce
the text faithfully would be to reproduce the world around it. We do not,
however, as readers, usually care for all of a text's physical attributes.
Stains and scratches on the paper's surface are usually discarded in
reproduction. They are not seen as meaningful for the understanding of text.

Thus whenever we think of Shakespeare's *King Lear*, for example, whatever is
meant by the "format" of the play belongs neither wholly to its physical
medium (pixel or paper) nor to the ideational content of the work. Format, in
that sense, lies somewhere between the two worlds: it is in the shape of the
letters, in the structure of the narrative, and in the prosody of the word. We
do not quite know which of these elements belong to the content of the play
and which are the contingent material artifacts of the printing process: the
way the fonts look, for example, or the way lines break on the page. Some
matters of format matter to us as readers (line breaks), while others may not
(font kerning, for example). The tradition of textual criticism reminds the
literary theorist of the transition that happens between literary texts and
literary works. The transformation between ideas and things is always a
fraught process, because whatever the theorist may believe about the dynamics
of interpretation must be weighed against the material affordances of the
specific textual witness. A word, a comma not included into the text cannot
become a part of meaning making. Formatting practices keep the gates of
interpretation.

[^ln3-remind]: See for example @shillingsburg_being_2006;
@greetham_textual_1989.

In a meditation on pictographs and pictographic logic Johanna Drucker and
Jerome McGann write about the "presentational form of texts" which usually
masks their "logical operations in a surface rhetoric that dominates and
controls our conscious attention." "The physicality of textual marks and
shapes disappear in an act of reading determined to highlight certain kinds of
conceptual references (content)," they continue. At the same time, what the
authors call the "holistic repleteness of images" also keeps us from
perceiving their "conceptual order [...] as if the graphic character of the
work were completely obvious" [@drucker_images_2010]. This important insight
captures the dual movement of formatting at once towards the physical
characteristics of the text and towards the mental characteristics of the
content. Ideation ally, the reader understands the text as a mental construct
that takes shape in the mind. The book subsides into obscurity, as Percy
Lubbock wrote in *The Craft of Fiction*. Subsequently, readers tend to treat
text in a disembodied fashion---surface rhetoric---forgetting about the
material structures that support the mental phenomena. Phenomenologically
speaking however, the page presents itself holistically, at once, as a unified
image, in what the Drucker and McGann call its "holistic repleteness." It is
as if it was always so: these words were always in this order, at these
coordinates. The printer and the book designer know that it is not so. Drucker
and McGann write that "systems of graphic presentation are operational, not
merely passive schematic structures [...] active agents for creating meaning,
instructions for reading, viewing, comprehending information
[@drucker_images_2010].

We are finally confronted with several concrete differences between print and
digital formats for text resolution. Editors and textual scholars negotiate
the instruction set for reading, viewing, and comprehending information in
print in advance of publication. The choice to include or to exclude certain
words, versions, or visual elements of the text is set into the page, where it
remains statically in place for the duration of a book's life cycle. The book
itself provides a stable platform for a range of reading practices, which
include annotation, copying, and the preservation of written work. To the
extent that books determine the affordances of reading, those affordances
exhibit historical continuity. For example, the format of the book presupposes
several physical abilities like manual dexterity, reading capability, and
eyesight within a specific range of vision. In return, the book affords tasks
like highlighting and the taking of notes. Empty space on a page around the
text facilitates marginalia. For the highlighter or the pen to function well
the printing medium must be made of a porous material, and not, for example,
plastic, which would make marking the page difficult while affording other
capabilities, like reading under water.[^ln3-notes]

[ln3-notes]: See @blair_note_2004; @daston_taking_2004; @piper_note_2012.

The affordances of the electronic book are more diffuse. On the one hand, the
format of the book has been replaced with a multitude of competing digital
formats, each vying to supplant print to become the singular, unified reading
platform. The family of book- and document-related application software made
by Adobe Systems, the company behind the popular Portable Document Format,
includes Adobe Digital Editions, which the reader can use "to download and
purchase digital content, which can be read both online and offline. The
platform's "features" include the ability to "download and transfer books
between devices," "searching eBooks," support for multiple languages, the
ability to borrow books, printing, limited support for visually impaired
readers, bookmarking, highlights, notes, and file organization [@_plans_2016].
Its own competing Adobe Document Cloud reading platform includes the Free,
Standard, and Pro versions of Acrobat Reader, "the global standard for
reliably viewing, printing, and commenting on PDF documents" [@_adobe_2016].
Only the most expensive Pro version allows one to "create and validate PDFs to
meet accessibility standards for people with disabilities." The free version
does not support bookmarks or document editing. The Pro version allow enables
readers to "redact and permanently remove sensitive information in PDFs" and
to "compare two version of a document to see what's changed" [@_plans_2016].
The Amazon Kindle reader, made by the world's largest purveyor of book both
print and electronic, includes a feature called "Public Notes" which allows
Kindle customers to "make their highlights and notes available for anyone to
see" [@_amazon_2015]. The frequently asked question page further explains that
"if someone you follow has highlighted a passage in a book and has turned on
Public Notes for the book, you'll see that passage highlighted along with the
name of the person who highlighted it." The FAQ continues to tout the benefits
of their platform:

> Now authors, thought leaders, passionate readers, professors and all Kindle
users can opt-in to share their notes with other readers, helping friends,
family members, and other Kindle users who choose to follow them to get more
from their reading. If someone you follow has highlighted a passage in a book
and has turned on Public Notes for the book, you'll see that passage
highlighted along with the name of the person who highlighted it. You'll also
see the notes that they made in the book [@_amazon_2016] The Google Play Books
platform does not have a public note features nor does it support book
editing. It does however add the ability to translate words and passages and
to search for selected phrases using the company's search engine
[@_read_2016]. In short, the electronic book cannot be reduced to a single
platform. The affordances of reading, taking notes, sharing, and storing books
are determined by the software, governed by specific socio-economic
contingencies. Thus a book available in North America, might be be available
on other continents, or it could be available elsewhere in a redacted form,
its content tailored to the reader's geography dynamically.

On the other hand, my remarks about the diffuse affordances of the electronic
book hold true only for interaction through the sanctioned "front end" modes
of access. For example, note that all of the major book platforms I have
mentioned above are coupled tightly with their respective book markets.
Whatever the comparative affordances of reading an Amazon ebook versus the
book expressed in the Adobe Document Cloud, the software must emulate the
logics of document ownership. To own an electronic book or a document means
significantly different things depending on the specific affordances of the
given platform. In another sense, to own a book in each case means to have
access to the bits that bring the simulation of the book into existence. At
some lower level of abstraction the variety of reading platforms rest on the
computational substratum. This hyper-media, as Lev Manovich calls it,
underlies all simulacra, including the bibliographic
[@manovich_software_2013]. A common act of epistemic disobedience, to borrow
from Walter Mignolo, therefore includes accessing the book bits more directly,
through unsanctioned channels [@mignolo_epistemic_2009]. One can for example
disentangle models of document ownership embodied in an Amazon Kindle document
format from the "content" of the book itself. The so called "ripping" of the
Kindle book library involves reformatting individual books into other forms
which could hypothetically enable unfettered copying and circulation,
constrained by original platform. The activity need not be illicit. The
extraction of plain text from the Portable Document Format commonly
constitutes the initial step in scholarly corpus analysis or distant reading.

In each of the above examples, the reader confronts some aspect of formatting
instrumentally, for a particular purpose like copying, analysis, or
preservation. I am however also interested in a more systematic wholesale
exposition of electronic document structure. Reading for format involves the
deconstruction, both literal and figuratively historical, of the literary
device. Where paper books present the reader with a limited set of known
affordances tied to the print medium, electronic books present us with a
virtually limitless and for the most part unexamined set of simulated
affordances. Whatever interpretive activity readers hope to enact at the level
of textual representation is grounded in the material affordances of the
simulated book. The responsibility for formatting no longer belongs to the
singular act of edition making. A number of agents actively intercede in the
transition between the inscription---information on a disk---and its
representation---pixels on the screen. These intercessions may be benign, as
when the electronic book changes the layout of the text to fit a smaller
screen when displaying text on mobile devices; or it may be totalizing as when
a book platform is designed also to censor or to surveil its readers for
commercial or political purposes. Reading for format reveals the structure of
the transformation between media: the liquid crystal, the floating gate, and
the entorhinal grid. The format governs and controls in the sense of
shaping the encounter between otherwise incommensurate systems, hardware and
wetware---storage, screen, and brain.

[^ln3-hex]: In this last regard see @stensola_entorhinal_2012. This
ground-breaking work describes the structure of data in the human brain.

### 3.3 Format Theory

A notion of formatting underlies all contemporary digital documents. The
history of formatting reveals a structure that emerges initially for the
purposes of visual layout, developing into an active agent containing
"instructions for reading, viewing, and comprehending information" of the sort
Drucker and McGann highlight in their work. I would like to spend the second
half of this chapter on several case studies from the still unwritten history
of formatting. These case studies will help test our theoretical intuitions
about form in practice. They serve also to convince the reader of the
continual importance of textual criticism and format studies for the
advancement of literary scholarship and more broadly for the politics of
reading and interpretation at large. If, as we conventionally intuit, the
format layer arbitrates between medium and symbol---word and page---then it
must also play a part in the encounter between human and text. Format in a
sense determines the available reading strategies, including the one of not
reading at all: thus an archive under lock and key, the management of copy
rights and borrowing privileges, the sensor's viscous black ink.

![EDIT Document Model, 1968 [@kaiman_computer-aided_1968, 66].](images/edit.png)

Describing *EDIT*, one of the first editors designed for the GE635 36-bit
mainframe computers in use at Bell Labs in 1968, Arthur Kaiman wrote: "The
publication editor is divided into three related sections, the document layout
facility, the editing facility, and the printing facility"
[@kaiman_computer-aided_1968, 66]. The "layout," in Kaiman's vocabulary,
contains such things as justification, indentation, and spacing. These
"primitive requests" can be combined to describe more complex "structures of
the printed text." The creators of *QED*, another influential early text
editor (created for the SDS-930 time-sharing system at Berkeley) similarly
encouraged the writer "to think in terms of structure" of the text. *QED* and
*EDIT* were some of the first text editors to separate notions of "content"
and "formatting," which were meant to be recombined later and imprinted onto
external storage media. Kaiman explains that "the user types the document
layout file and the text file, then produces a proof or master copy of the
text by printing the text according to the directions of the layout file. The
text file contains layout marks to be interpreted by the layout file." "Text,"
in this schema, constitutes content meaningful only to the user, whereas
layout contains some elements meaningful to the human and some elements as
code instructions intended for device control. Layout in that sense asks the
human editor to make a distinction between semantic an spatial units: words
and their coordinates.

IBM's FORMAT text program, written in FORTRAN IV for OS/360 devices in 1968,
discusses formatting in terms of "text control." "All input to FORMAT is
free-form, in that there are no positional constraints," the author of the
program writes [@berns_format_1968, 85; @berns_description_1969, 141]." Text
control under the FORMAT model was limited to several "command words" that
included "P" for "begin new paragraph," "T" for "tab," and "A" for "print 'as
is', maintaining spacing of the input" [@berns_description_1969, 141]. EDIT
also had the capability of building an index, in effect listing all the unique
words in any given document, along with a rudimentary facility for search, or
in its own works for "locating text words, phrases, and strings in the input
stream" [@berns_format_1968, 91; @berns_description_1969, 145]. In another
formative paper in the history of contemporary textuality, Brian Kernighan and
Joseph Ossanna describe TROFF, a text processor written circa 1973 for the
PDP-11 outputting to Graphic Systems Cat typesetter. In 1979, Kernighan
reports modifying the original program to produce output for a greater variety
of typesetters. Kernighan explains, "TROFF produces its output in a
device-independent form," and its output "must be processed by a drive for
that device to produce printed output" [@kernighan_troff_1992].

More than a decade later, reflecting on the proliferation of text editors the
authors advance the following unified theory of format. "A *document* is an
object composed of a hierarchy of primitive objects," the authors write. The
objects are further divided into "abstract" or "logical" objects and their
"concrete" instantiations. The authors explain: "an abstract object is denoted
by an identifier and the class to which the object belongs." By contrast,
concrete objects occupy "one or more two-dimensional page spaces and represent
the possible formatted images of abstract objects" [@furuta_document_1982,
418]. In other words, the concrete object gives physical shape, layout, or
style to the instantiation of abstract universal classes like paragraphs and
sentences. Concrete objects are abstract paragraphs and sentences "laid out"
in page space. In this schema, the word "cat" embodies a concrete object, a
physical inscription at a given location. It further denotes the identifier
for the idea of "cat," which belongs to the class "word". Note that by this
model, cats are not classified under the their semantic category of "felines."
Rather, we are concerned with the abstract type of the identifier itself.
Other primitive classes include paragraphs, sections, paragraphs, and
footnotes, for example. A document can therefore be expressed as a
hierarchical ordering of such primitive objects. In this way, we may think of
a "novel" as an abstract succession of "chapters," which in turn encapsulate
"paragraphs" that contain "sentences and words," further composed of
"characters." These abstract units must then find their physical manifestation
on a page. They stand in a hierarchical relationship to each other because
paragraphs contain sentences, and sentences words, and not the other way
around. Together, the primitive object classes make up more sophisticated
abstractions like "letters," "articles," "books," and "journals"
[@furuta_document_1982, 417-19; @shaw_model_1980].

The classes / instance distinction allows us to think of editing and
formatting tasks in terms of state transformations. In this way, editing the
document involves the transition abstract states, as when the author corrects
spelling for example. Concrete to concrete editing transitions can involve the
sequential rearrangement of sentences or paragraphs, or moving data from one
table to another. Crucially for our discussion, the authors define formatting
as the reification of abstract classes into the real: the application of font
styles, for example. Formatting in that sense converts what the authors call
the "intended document" into the "visible concrete document." Between these
two polarities we observe the document description, at which stage content and
physical text specifications are mixed together and laid out for viewing on a
particular device [@furuta_document_1982, 419-22]. This last part is
important, as many systems are designed to display text without "knowing" in a
sense the ultimate physical dimensions of the target device. We can think for
example of document files that are rendered in more or less the same way on a
multitude of screens of varying sizes. Nothing in the code guarantees the
dimensions of the visible concrete document. We are only assured of the proper
structure: that the paragraphs will have a certain spacing, that the footnotes
appear on the bottom of the page, and so on.

We can think of examples of other formatting operations which move in the
opposite direction: from concrete to abstract for example. This happens in
optical character recognition, in the process by which the image of a physical
page is converted into an intended, abstract structure, the "content" thereby
lifted from the physical page. A text in the portable document format (.pdf)
can remain a graphic image---a concrete, indivisible object---until the text
is recognized. One car read it, of course, but it does not, from the machine's
point of view contain text or "abstract objects" as such. Leaving aside the
somewhat strained language in which machines have views and cognitive states
like recognition, recognition in this case implies more narrowly the
conversation of image into text. Text is a marked data format within machine
epistemology. Recognition involves converting "image" type data structures
into "text" types. Text, in that sense, lies at the innermost location in
series of nested "outer" containers. Lacking a model of "comprehension" or
"understanding," the machine posits text as "content" in the sense of it being
the "innermost" object of recognition.

The "recognition" of characters does not exhaust the variety of abstract
document objects, which besides letters and words include paragraphs, tables,
titles, and footnotes. These also count as "content," in some sense of the
word. It is essential therefore to know "where text resides on the page,"
since some elements of positioning in themselves can carry meaning. For
instance, proper names could carry different connotations depending on their
positioning on the page. A name in the "author field" means something distinct
from any other name mentioned in the body of the document. Lawrence O'Gorman,
an influential researcher in the field of document image processing, calls the
recognition of this sort of object, at the intersection of concrete and
universal, "document lay-out understanding," which consists of "functional
labeling of blocks [...] distinguished in some way by their physical features
(such as by font size) and by the 'meaning' of the block
[@ogorman_document_1993, 1162-63; @ogorman_document_1995, 82-99 (in the
reconstructed edition)]." Note also that document layout (alternatively
"formatting" or the arrangement of "concrete objects") could also incorporate
meaningless (to humans) structures, such as the incidental "rivers" of empty
space formed between the words. That sort of concrete structure goes
unrecognized because it does not correspond to any abstract objects in the
available document object taxonomy.

![Method for extracting document structure based on "nearest-neighbor clustering
of page components" [@ogorman_document_1993, 1164].](images/docstrum.png)

Finally, we may describe *viewing* or *printing* a document as a chain of
formatting operations that transform one type of concrete object, bits
arranged spatially on the disk, into an abstract structure called the Document
Object Model, and further into another type of concrete objects, pixels
arrange in space on a screen or ink on a page. The Document Object Model
contains a description of possible two-dimensional spaces like pages and
screens of differing sizes, signifying relationships between elements within a
range of possible concrete objects."[^ln4-dom] To materialize, the
hierarchical model must be fixed and arranged on the surface of an actual
medium, according to a set of predefined rules specified in the model. These
media have actual dimensions. In this way, a footnote specified "at the bottom
of the page" at the level of the model can then be rendered one way at the
bottom of a specific page of a certain size, like A1 (841mm × 1,189mm) for
example, and in another way at the bottom of another specific piece of paper
of a much smaller A4-sized sheet (210mm × 297mm).[^ln4-iso216] Viewing and
printing operations constitute a movement opposite to that of optical
character recognition. In printing a document, the machine creates a static
image flattening out layers of content and visual style. The abstract objects
are reified into the concrete. [@furuta_document_1982, 419-20;
@kimura_structure_1984].  For example, SCRIPT and the related Generalized
Markup Language (GML) developed in the late 1960s by IBM (originally for use
on the CP67/CMS time-sharing system), and now at the basis of ubiquitous XML
and HTML markup languages through ISO 8879, describes a number of such text
transformations that occur to "generate the proper output form." In
formatting, SCRIPT represents the "logical topology" of text in its "canonical
form" to produce an "intermediate data structure," which it then "'unfolds'
all at once" by "'peeling' the data structure one level at a time"
[@madnick_script_1968, 97]. 

<!--
!["System Command and Data Flow." Flows and transformations between data
structures at "disk file" level and text structures at the "user terminal" and
the "line printer" levels [@madnick_script_1968, 98].](images/script.png)
-->

The format must not however be reduced to the mere application of visual style
to words. Formatter designers from TROFF to FORMAT explicitly describe their
programs in terms of instrumental *control*. For example, Richard Berns, the
IBM engineer-developer of FORMAT, writes that in his program, "text control"
aims to accomplish four "basic" tasks: "to read the input, to interpret and
convert the input as required; to keep the document flowing smoothly from line
to line, column to column, and page to page, unless otherwise instructed, and
to break this automatic flow as directed." In FORMAT the document consists of
text and intermixed "command words" [@berns_description_1969, 141]. The *TROFF
User's Manual* describes text processing in terms of accepting "lines of text
interspersed with lines of format control information" [@kernighan_troff_1992,
3]. Because format concerns both meaning-carrying and purely decorative
elements, text control can involve operations like "replace word," "make
invisible," or "insert file." These commands intertwine with "free-form"
abstract and ideational content at the formatting level, to come into being in
the "viewing" stage of text processing, where the layers flatten across "a
two-dimensional space" in view of the user. In this onion-like, layered way
formatting instructions govern the reification of abstract content models into
specific documents, shaping the idea in the process of becoming a thing.

### 3.4 Smart Contracts

Reading for format involves the reconstruction of rules that govern the
transformation of text, thereby giving us a notion of literal surface and
depth that differs from their figurative senses. Metaphorically-speaking,
textual depth refers to concealed structures of meaning, literary formulae,
signification, or ideology. In another, more literal sense, depth refers to
the formation of literary laminates that hold the inscription in suspense
between layers of glass, plastic, liquid crystal, aluminum, iridium, and
oxide. The move between paper and such *composite* media carries with it a
profound shift in the physical affordances of everyday document. Not much
space separates ink from paper. There, textuality lies flat, in two
dimensions. What you see is truly what you get. Not so on the screen connected
to other screens.  Networked and time-shared textuality extends into the third
dimension, away from the reader and deep into the bowels of the machine. 

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model of
communication[^ln3-osi] describes no less than seven layers: from the
Application Layer, concerned with the semantics of application ("all services
directly comprehensible to the user [@miller_iso_1981, 285] to the Physical
Layer, providing the "mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural
characteristics" of communication [@ncs_open_1981; @ncs_national_1988;
@day_revised_1995].[^ln3-layers] These protocols further envelop a document
already thickly stratified by the Document Object Model.[^ln3-domlayer]

[^ln3-domlayer]: The DOM technically exists at the application layer of the OSI
model.

![A zoomed out view of the connected OSI model. Single node structure on the
left. Connected devices on the right. The user has access through the top-most
(application) level, outermost to the network [@piatkowski_iso-ansi_1980,
114-15].](images/osi.png)

In his book on protocols, Alexander Galloway discusses the Open Systems
Interconnection model in reference to what he calls the distributed and
decentralized networks of control [@galloway_protocol_2006, 28-54]. The system
described by the OSI standard is distributed to be sure, although to what
extent it is decentralized is a matter of some debate. Like a good soldier,
each device in the pictured network internalizes dozens if not hundreds of
protocols that enable the system to function seamlessly as a whole (in the
way, for example, that your machine can at one moment connect to one wireless
access point, and at another moment to another, with minimal loss of
connectivity). Yet, OSI protocols and the document object model hierarchies
are also densely consolidated. They are, for example, legislated by specific
international governing bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium, with a
member list that includes government organizations and large corporate
interests.[^ln3-w3c]

Stretched between the sites of its archive and its projection, the solid state
drive and the screen, the inscription travels along a long "pipeline" of
protocols, undergoing a set of arbitrary transformations throughout. On one
device, that pipeline may extend just a few inches, connecting disk storage
and output display. On a network device that pipeline can stretch across
continents, spanning widely divergent regions of legal and administrative
governance. The data that assembles the nearby object we call an electronic
book may be stored on a server on the other side of the country. Whatever the
case may be, the reader encounters the "protocol stack" from without on the
periphery of the onion-like network. When paging through an electronic book,
usually an OSI-compliant device, the reader has access only to the outputs
emanating from the application layer, and, at that, only at the exposed
"window" level of the document-object model. The perceived "content" therefor
constitutes a small fraction of the underlying formal topology. What you see
is far less than what you get.

The reading subject and the application layer interface superficially. Access
to the layers intrinsic to device operation (and consequently to analysis) are
sometimes merely obscured and sometimes made illicit outright, as is arguably
the case with U.S. Code, Title 17, Chapter 12, §1201, titled "Circumvention of
copyright protection systems" and passed as part of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998. A literary scholar may be familiar with some
provisions of American copyright law governing text as surface representation:
US Code, Title 17 extends "exclusive rights" to "copyright owners" of
"literary works." The rights include the ability to "reproduce," "to prepare
derivative works," "to distribute copies," and "to perform and to display
publicly" (17.1.106). Surface representation is further subject to
professional rules of conduct, embodied in practices of quotation, citation,
and attribution (or lack thereof, as plagiarism). In practice, the easy
reproducibility of digital text (and image) has served to erode the efficacy
of copyright restrictions. The work of art in the age of digital reproduction
has lost much of its already tenuous hold on the material
substratum.[^ln3-illusion] Copy technologies from photocopiers, to desktop
printers, to cheap digital storage and peer-to-peer file sharing networks
reduce the price of copying and dissemination to near frictionless levels. The
response from the film, game, music, and publishing industries has been to
transpose mechanisms of copyright enforcement from legal down to the
infrastructural levels of enforcement, as software and hardware: from Code to
code. In the words of Charles Clark, the late British publisher and prominent
copyright attorney, "the answer to the machine is in the machine
[@clark_copyright_1996, 81-82]"---by which he meant that copyright enforcement
should be taken up on the device level by the International Standards
Organization, the very body responsible for maintaining the standards for the
Document Object Model and the OSI communication protocol stack
[@clark_copyright_1996, 84].

As an example of how that might work, Clark cites the Copyright in Transmitted
Electronic Data Report (CITED), which suggests building "a tamper proof
software module which acts rather like indestructible tachometers installed on
long-distance coaches and lorries, recording everything that happens to the
copyrighted or commercially valuable material [...] The basic idea is to link
the 'valuable material' of intellectual property to a specific piece of
software and hardware" [@consortium_c.i.t.e.d._1994; @clark_copyright_1996,
83-84]. The emergence of such embedded contractual enforcement at the level of
the device can be subsumed under the broader idea of "smart contracts." In his
seminal article on "Formalizing and Securing Relationships in Public
Networks," Nick Szabo explains that "smart contracts combine protocols, user
interfaces, and promises expressed via those interfaces to formalize and
secure relationships over computer networks" [@szabo_formalizing_1997]. Clark,
CITED, and Szabo were instrumental in the rise of smart contracts in the 1990s
in an attempt to redress the fading efficacy of legal copyright
protections.[^ln3-smart]

"Method and System for Managing a Data Object so as to Comply with
Predetermined Conditions for Usage" (US5845281, issued in 1998) can be
instructive in this regard. Greg Benson and Gregory H. Urich, both of Sweden,
write:

> The data object owner may want to have permanent secure control over how,
when, where, and by whom his property is used. Furthermore, he may want to
define different rules of engagement for different types of users and different
type of security depending on the value of particular objects. The rules
defined by him shall govern the automated operations enabled by data services
and networking. The owner may also sell composite objects with different rules
governing each constituent objects. Thus, it is necessary to be able to
implement variable and extensible control.

The data object, in this case, stands for any media content, from books to
music, video, and software. Rather then legislating rules for copying and
distributing media, the inventors suggest that the medium itself should
contain a control layer that would "comply with predetermined conditions of
usage," in a way that can be "universally adapted to the needs of both the
owner and the user of the data object" [@benson_method_1998, 2:55].

!["Concatenated control data and AVI file in memory" [@benson_method_1998].](images/avi-control.png)

!["Concatenated and encrypted control data and AVI file in memory"
[@benson_method_1998].](images/avi-control2.png)

The associated schematics (pictured here) show data and control codes
"concatenated" into the same underlying data structure (in this case, AVI
media container format). The seemingly innocuous "text control" layer of the
1960s, used to specify formatting and visual style, was now extended to carry
mechanisms for legal control, tied to specific legislation.

The idea of smart contracts contains a notable artifact of implementation,
relevant to our discussion on surface reading. To the extent that control
codes are legible to the interpreter, they are also open to "abuse and
circumvention." For this reason, encryption plays a key part in the smart
contracts system. Once intertwined, data and control are often encrypted to
prevent "unauthorized access." This brings us to the glaring problem at the
very heart of smart contract implementation. The spirit of contractual law by
its very nature demands *explicit* consent. In the language of English common
law, contracts involve promises as "manifestation of intention," which "adopt
an external or objective standard for interpreting conduct
[@american_law_institute_restatement_1973, §1-2.]" The key words in this
passage are "external," "objective," and "interpretation."

By contrast, smart contracts, as described in the patent archive, must rely on
encrypted---that is, not human-legible---forms of tacit compliance: neither
external, objective, nor available for interpretation. The idea of encrypted
consent stands in stark opposition to a tradition of contract law that relies
on models of consent that involve expressed, mutual, explicit, and uncoerced
forms of acquiescence. Even if smart contracts were to be accompanied by
legible documentation (as Terms of Service, for example), the reader of an
electronic book would be compelled to blindly trust in the correspondence
between the expressed letter and the implicit mechanism of the document---the
implementation still enacted beyond scrutiny, in the form of hidden,
encrypted, and purposefully illegible script.

Moreover, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) stipulates that "no
person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls
access to a work protected under this title (17.1201.a.1.A)." The letter of the
law further specifies that to "circumvent a technological measure," in this
case, means "to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or
otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological
measure, without the authority of the copyright owner (17.1201.a.3.A)." A
technological measure that "effectively controls access" is further defined as
a measure that "in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the
application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of
the copyright owner, to gain access to the work (17.1201.a.3.B)." For a
literary scholar, that means that, when encountering a text on a digital
device, reading sometimes *must* limit itself to surface phenomena. An attempt
at reading for depth---to discover the implemented terms of a smart contract,
for example---may carry with it a set of official (even criminal)
sanctions.[^ln3-fairuse]

The short history of DMCA "anti-circumvention" provisions is already littered
with ambiguous case law, which the Electronic Frontiers Foundation believes to
have the effect of "stifling a wide range of legitimate activities," "chilling
free expression and academic research," "jeopardizing fair use," and "impeding
innovation [@von_lohmann_unintended_2010]." Several incidents stand out as
particularly relevant to the study of literature. One, a security researcher
exploring the activity of censorship filters on public library computers was
threatened and forced to seek DMCA exemption from the Librarian of Congress
[@fry_circumventing_2009]. Two, a Russian programmer speaking at a security
conference was jailed and detained for several months for developing software
that converts Adobe electronic book files into `.pdf` format, in a process
that could potentially remove embedded digital rights management protections
[@ferullo_major_2004; @mueller_reinventing_2004; @postigo_information_2010].
Finally, in 2005 Agfa Monotype Corporation took Adobe Systems to court in a
dispute over the Adobe Acrobat "Free Text" tool, which allowed users to
"change text annotations using Plaintiff's TrueType fonts" without a license
[@_agfa_2005; @lipton_c_2009; @von_lohmann_unintended_2010]. The precedent of
these cases could be used to physically limit the efficacy of reading digital
texts. Readers and literary scholars could soon find themselves prohibited
from studying the dynamics of censorship, prevented from using computational
methods that rely on text mining, and unable to extract the fruits of their
philological activity from proprietary annotation platforms.

[^ln3-fairuse]: DMCA 1201 provides for a number of complicated exemptions,
which may, under some interpretations, sanction limited use for academic
purposes. See @liu_dmca_2003; @ku_critique_2004; @herman_catch_2005;
@armstrong_digital_2006.

The impact of DMCA and smart contracts on the practices of reading, writing, and
literary analysis is potentially immense. In the language of the DMCA, the
electronic book is not a book at all, but a "data object," in which the modest
copyright symbol gives way to "control layers [@fischer_digital_2003]." An
essay in the *Yale Journal of Law & Technology* explains it this way:

> While e-books and their print counterparts embody essentially identical
> content, from a transactional standpoint they differ considerably. Books are
> tangible goods that can be owned, sold, and passed on without express
> limitation--the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) governs their sale, while
> copyright law protects their content. But despite appearances, Kindle e-books
> are not, according to Amazon, sold at all: they are distributed under
> restrictive license terms, similar to downloaded software
[@seringhaus_e-book_2010, 150].

In these conditions, literature is forced to relinquish its ontologically
indeterminate status. The DMCA attempts to arrest the movement of texts
between their concrete and abstract manifestations. Reified into a concrete
object the book becomes a device, no longer lasting and universal, but rather
ephemeral and contingent, firmly determined by its instrumental affordances.
The literary device gains the ability to dynamically adapt itself "to the
needs of both the owner and the user." These adaptations could take a benign
function, of the kind suggested in "*Remix: Literatur*," where Michel Chaouli
imagines a device akin to a "literature equalizer," empowering readers to
"tune" any given text to their liking [@chaouli_remix_2009]. Don't really like
intensifiers? Just turn the "adverb knob" down! I hold on to the possibility
of building such a device with Chaouli. In the meantime, existing electronic
book software and hardware devices adapt themselves to the reader in less
creative ways. Some prevent simple copy and paste actions. Others can be used
to censor and surveil. For a textual critic, such instability of medium means
analysis cannot be confined to reading for surface meaning alone.  How can
close or distant reading practices persist, when the reading device
reconfigures a text dynamically, to fit individual taste, mood, or
politics?[^ln3-modern] Or, when it simply prevents access to some of the
content? Essential for the practices of unencumbered critical thought, control
structures exist in the gaps within the splintered sign. Ultimately, parts of
the inscription that remain invisible affect more than typesetting
characteristics. They shape the very structure of interpretation. The
seemingly innocuous control and formatting layer contains the essence of
machine control. Long a marginal concept in literary theory, formatting is
therefore central to the practice of computational poetics. Far from mere
inconsequential embellishment, formatting governs the interface between
meaning and matter, thought and page. It has the capability to embellish, to
obscure, to censor, to govern, and to emend.

[^ln3-modern]: Note that these effects are not limited to contemporary
literature at all. In purchasing a medieval text, the reader still buys not a
text or a work but a device, which, despite the content being out of copyright
protection, may still restrict access to other, protected layers of device
function.

our general thoughts are apt to be confused---but one particular body: this
piece of wax, for example. It has just been taken from the honeycomb; it still
tastes of honey and has the scent of the flowers from which the honey was
gathered; its color, shape and size are plain to see; it is hard, cold and can
be handled easily; if you rap it with your knuckle it makes a sound. In short,
it has everything that seems to be needed for a body to be known perfectly
clearly. But as I speak these words I hold the wax near to the fire, and look!
The taste and smell vanish, the color changes, the shape is lost, the size
increases; the wax becomes liquid and hot; you can hardly touch it, and it no
longer makes a sound when you strike it. But is it still the same wax? Of
course it is; no one denies this. So what was it about the wax that I
understood so clearly? Evidently it was not any of the features that the senses
told me of; for all of them---brought to me through taste, smell, sight, touch
or hearing---have now altered, yet it is still the same wax."

[^ln4-bottom]: For example, in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of

the "application layer" and the bottom-most layer the "physical layer"
[@peterson_computer_2007, 26-28]. Timothy Colburn and Gary Shute describe it as
being "responsible for encoding bits onto a transmission medium, whether wires,
fiber optics, or radio broadcast, in ways that maximize the transmission rate
and minimize sensitivity to noise [@colburn_abstraction_2007, 181].

[^ln4-abstraction]: This is a topic of some contention in the literature. In
his influential paper on the topic, James Moor includes the immateriality of
software as one of the "three myths" of computer science. "As a practical
matter, what we regard as computer instructions, and consequently what we
regard as computer programs, is determined by computers available," he writes
[@moor_three_1978, 215]. Nurbay Irmark argues that software is instead a purely

disconcert us, were we not forewarned of the name of the *object* of knowledge,
which can only exist in the form of ideology" [@althusser_reproduction_2014,
46].

[^ln4-derr]: See @derrida_writing_1978. I am alluding particularly to
statements like "ethnology-like any science-comes about within the element of
discourse," and "this moment was that in which language invaded the universal
problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything
became discourse-provided we can agree on this word-that is to say, when
everything became a system where the central signified, the original or
transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of
differences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and
the interplay of signification ad infinitum" (278-294).

[^ln4-flip]: There is a long-standing joke in Marxist literature that involves
flipping Hegel, who prioritized the transcendent spiritual over the physical
and material forms of life, over "back to his feet." See for example
@marx_marx-engels_1978: "The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making
a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common,
every-day thing, wood. But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is
changes into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feed on the
ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and
evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than
'table-turning' ever was" (320). See also @engels_ludwig_1941: "Thereby the
dialectic of the concept itself became merely the conscious reflex of the
dialectical motion of the real world and the dialectic of Hegel was placed
upon its head; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing
before, and placed on its feet again" (44).  p5
