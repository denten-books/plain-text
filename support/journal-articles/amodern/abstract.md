Digital text is difficult to locate. It exists at once onscreen and off:
hidden from view on hard drives, tactile at the finger tips, and ephemeral
before the eyes. In this essay I propose to examine it as a stratified,
laminate structure. Using archival materials from the history of twentieth
century technology, I advance a theory of laminate text grounded in the
physical affordances of the medium. It proceeds in three parts, after a brief
methodological discussion. In the first layer or “sediment,” we observe the
development of special, encoded languages used to store data on ticker tape
and punch cards. The second layer is characterized by its increasing opacity:
expressed in electromagnetic polarities inscription becomes inaccessible to
human senses. Finally, a layer of simulated inscription is laid down to
restore the appearance of a single surface. Each stage, I argue in conclusion,
presents distinct challenges to contemporary practices of reading and
interpretation.
