Digital text is difficult to locate. It exists at once onscreen and off:
hidden from view on hard drives, tactile at the finger tips, and ephemeral
before the eyes. In this essay I propose to examine it as a stratified,
laminate structure. Using archival materials from the history of twentieth
century technology, I develop a theory of laminate text grounded in the
physical affordances of the medium. It proceeds in three parts, after brief
theoretical and methodological discussions. In the first layer or “sediment,”
I describe the admixture of natural language and control code, meant for
machine consumption. The second is characterized by its increasing opacity:
inscription becomes inaccessible to human senses. Finally, a layer of
simulated inscription is laid down to restore some of the apparent plasticity
lost in the process of lamination.
