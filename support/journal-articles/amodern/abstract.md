Using archival materials from the history of twentieth century technology, I
advance a theory of laminate text grounded in the physical affordances of the
medium. It proceeds in three parts, after a brief methodological discussion at
the intersection of literary theory and media history. In the first layer or
“sediment,” we observe the development of encoded languages used to store data
on ticker tape and punch cards. The second layer is characterized by its
increasing opacity: electromagnetic storage becomes inaccessible to human
senses. Finally, a layer of simulated inscription is laid down to restore the
appearance of a single surface onscreen. Each sediment presents distinct
challenges to contemporary practices of reading and interpretation.
