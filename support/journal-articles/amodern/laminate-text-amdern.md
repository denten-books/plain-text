Laminate Text: Material Contexts of Digital Knowledge Production
Dennis Yi Tenen

Digital text,  at the basis of all computer-mediated epistemological activity,
appears to view at once an ephemeral and enduring phenomenon. It is, as Wendy
Hui Kyong Chun wrote, an "enduringly ephemeral" inscription that "create[es]
unforeseen degenerative links between humans and machines."[^1] At the site of
its projection, on "soft" screens, the text shimmers and wanes, suspended in
liquid crystal, in response to the modulation of an electric signal. At the
site of its storage, on "hard" drives, among "floating gates" and
ferromagnetic polarities, the text adheres to recondite surfaces persistently.
There, it multiplies and obstinately spreads, like silicon dust, filling the
available crevices with stored data, far beyond the immediate contexts of
inscription.

This inherent duplicity of electromagnetic inscription, as I argue here,
results in conflicting critical accounts in the scholarly literature.
Furthermore, it engender a fundamental alienation from the material contexts
of digital knowledge production. The alienation ultimately threatens critical
disempowerment. In this essay, I outline a condition I name *laminate
textuality*, but which an inscription fractures to occupy multiple surfaces
concurrently. A historical archaeology of electromagnetic writing anchors the
more theoretical portion of the essay within the emerging affordances of
computational media, which take place, in part, at quantum scale, beyond the
reach of humans senses. Clandestine forces of capital and control subsequently
contest such newly found microscopic expanses, thus limiting the scope of
possible interpretive activity.

## Literary Composites

Little separates ink from paper in print. Ink permeates paper; the conduit is
firmly embedded into the medium. The amalgam of in and paper implies specific
physical properties and their related affordances: what the medium is relates
to what can be done with it.[^2] Print is stable on the scale of decades and
sometimes centuries. At the very least, once can be assured that a text will
remain the same as it passes from one pair of hands into another. As
interpreters of texts, we usually can (with some effort) make certain to find
ourselves, literally, on the same page and to insure that we are discussing
roughly the same piece of writing.

Traditional models of modernist hermeneutics often assume the relative
permanence of the medium.[^3] For example, Paul Ricoeur wrote about "the
possibility of transferring orders of long distances without serious
distortions" as related to the "birth of political rule exercised by a distant
state."[^4] Among other effects, Ricoeur attributed to the fixity of print
"the birth of market relationships" and economics, "the birth of justice" in
the fixity of the legal codex, "the constitution of archives" and therefore
the very possibility of history. He concluded to write that "such an immense
range of effects suggests that human discourse is not merely preserved from
destruction by being fixed in writing, but that it is deeply affected in its
communicative function."[^5]

The architecture of contemporary computational media---screens, hard drives,
and keyboards---cannot sustain the assumption of fixity. Electromagnetic
inscription occupies several available surfaces at once. It exists at once on
screen, itself a composite of glass panes and liquid crystal, and "in memory,"
as manifested in the arrangement of silicon and circuitry. The word is in the
wires. When reading digitally, on a personal computer for example, the
distance between these localities may extend a few inches, enough to cover the
space between a screen and a hard drive. In other contexts, when viewing text
on a commercial "electronic reader," that space may span continents as stored
data are transmitted over vast distances, between content "owners" and its
"users," who hold only a temporary right to peruse, limited in scope to
specific timelines and geographies. An electronic book borrowed from the New
York Public Library, for example, may be stored somewhere in New York, on
library servers. It disappears from my devices when the terms of my book
borrowing expire.

In this way, the digital sign is continually stretched, elongated, and
fractured across diverse material strata, subject to distinct local
affordances. A simple act of erasure on screen, as when one backspaces over a
word written in error, simulates a comparable action in print. However on
disk, metaphoric "erasure" takes on a different connotation, entailing an
entirely new set of operations, not congruent with the implied action on
screen or in print. The incongruence is often benign, particularly when
readers and writers are interested in handling surface representation,
operating on the level of words and ideas. However, in certain contexts, our
inability to perceive the mechanics of inscription at depth severely
undermines critical acuity. To take a blunt example, imagine a scholar or a
journalist who needs to redact unpublished materials in order to protect her
sources. Surface erasure in this case is insufficient to guarantee true
anonymity. Words erased on screen may persevere through deeper structures on
disk and among remote servers, in a way susceptible to malicious breach or
state-sponsored surveillance.

The affordances of laminate text depend not only on the medium, but also on
the contexts of its reception. The same "source text" may be transformed
according to its geography or the identity of its reader. The composition of
the sign changes as a text changes hands. A digital document may respond to a
reader's location, gender, age, or ethnicity. Think of an online newspaper, to
take a common example, where the very composition of headlines and stories are
often tailed to the reader. Such dynamic inscriptions contain the rules of
their own transformation. Content and control code intertwine to produce an
amalgamated artifact, which adapts to its context. The often covert presence
of control structures extend the reach of governance over the process of
interpretation. A government may censor speech through legislation, for
example, and prosecute those who express opinions contrary to the reigning
ideology. Similarly, mechanisms of censorship may be encoded into the fabric
of the laminate itself, through technologies that simply prevent prohibited
ideological formations from appearing on screen. Such technologies can also
limit the transmission and the reception of illicit material. Unlike those
censored explicitly, readers under the reach of algorithmic governance may not
be immediately aware of control mechanisms structuring their everyday
interpretive experience.

The stratified nature of digital inscription poses obvious challenges in a
political sphere. Our ability to mobilize against censorship or surveillance,
for example, is in peril when such mechanisms operate at a microscopic scale,
requiring specialized training and tools for interpretation. It also presents
a c challenge to the practice of literary hermeneutics more generally. How
does critical interpretive practice persist in conditions where readers can no
longer rely on the continuing stability of the medium? The theoretical problem
is not one where can choose to discuss texts as entities of pure immanence
or pure transcendence, enduring or ephemeral. We are confronted instead with
textuality that does not converge on a single location and with texts whose
multivalence is derived from their structural diffusion. The emerging
materialities of laminate text force us to reconsider long-standing critical
assumptions about the physics of inscription.

## Stratigraphy

Having summarized the basic theoretical concerns related to the emerging
material conditions laminate text, I would like to turn my attention now to
the historical archaeology of the medium itself. I borrow the term
"stratigraphy" from the field of archaeology proper, as opposed to media
archaeology where the term is used in its more evocative and metaphoric
sense.[^6] The art of analyzing sedimentary rock layers dates back at least to
the geological observations of the seventeenth century Danish scientist
Nicolas Steno, later extended by John Strachey in his *Observations on the
Different Strata of Earths and Minerals* (1727), and to the geological
cross-sections of William Smith and William Maclure, who drew beautifully
detailed cross-sections of the British and American landscapes [Figure 1].

The concept of stratigraphy is an apt borrowing when applied to the history of
computer technology, where the various layers of historical development are
often extant in one and the same device. In this manner, the legacy of machine
alphabets such as the Morse and Baudot alphabets is, in some real way, present
on modern devices through the ASCII and UTF-16 conventions. A
"conversational," text-based, model of human computer-interaction developed in
the 1960s, coexists with the later, graphic-based "direct-interaction" modes
of interaction in the innards of every modern mobile phone, game console, or
tablet.[^8] The same can be said about "low-level" assembly languages and
their alternatives like FORTRAN, LISP, and COBOL, continuously in use since
the 1950s alongside their modern descendants.

For the purposes of our conversation, which concerns the paradoxically
conflicting nature of electromagnetic inscription, at once enduring and
ephemeral, we may separate the formation of the extant strata of
electromagnetic inscription into three distinct historical categories. In the

The use of quotes signals the metaphoric nature of the borrowing. See also
