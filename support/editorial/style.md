# Plain Text: Style Sheet

## Editorial Styles

- No page extends (222–45 and not 222–245)

- Serial comma (orange, apples, and bananas).

- No hyphens with –ly, eg “expensively produced games”

- Minimal use of hyphens; to aid sense only

- Numbers: spell out one to nine, then 10 onwards (unless comparison within
same sentence, in which case make all either numerals or spelled out) 
but, with units of measurement, always use figs and mostly abbreviations, eg 7km but
7 miles as mi looks odd and confusing [nb, no space between number and unit] –
also, 50 percent, not 50%, unless in captions, table etc

- Displayed quoted matter: place full stop at end of quote text and then have
  source in brackets with no punctuation after; ie don’t place full stop after
bracketed sources. In-text quotes: closing quote marks before bracketed
citation and not after, with full stop/other punct after bracketed citation.

- Titles/headings: 2nd words in hyphenated terms lower cased unless would
  usually be uc; prepositions l.c.

- Art movements: mostly l.c., as per Chicago Manual, eg cubism

- Spell out centuries in main text: twentieth century but 20th century in
  captions/tables etc

- John Hughes's, not Hughes'

- No accents on capital letters (so, Emile Baudot)

- Multiple citations in main text: in chronological order and separated by
  semi-colons
