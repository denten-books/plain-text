In this paper, I would like to give a historical account of a letter's passage
from keystroke to pixel. The movement proceeds in three stages, as illustrated
by three specific devices: first the mechanization of type reached its apogee
in the telegraph at the end of the nineteenth century. With the advent of
telegraphy, "content" meant for humans began to intertwine with "control codes"
used to operate machines remotely. Second, where the ticker tape and the punch
card were still legible without specialized "reader" devices, the invention of
magnetic tape submerged the mixed stream of letters and control codes into an
inscrutable substance. Finally, by the mid-twentieth century, the screen
emerged to simulate a measure of legibility lost in the transition.

Thus when Michael Heim refers to the "ephemeral quality" of the electronic text
or when Pamela McCorduck describes it as "impermanent, flimsy, malleable, [and]
contingent" they identify real-world capabilities of simulated screen
textuality. And when scholars like Johnna Drucker, Katherine Hayles, and
Matthew Kirschenbaum respond with hardened materialism, they are also rightly
describing physical properties of the archived inscription. But the two camps
speak neither of the same phenomenon nor at the same site. The hard drive and
the screen splinter the sign between depth and surface. Both locations afford
distinct constraints to access, storage, and interpretation.
