Dear Emily-Jane,

I write with gratitude for your and your team's efforts in facilitating the
review of the manuscript. The review process helped sharpen my argument,
clarify the prose, and make the structure of the book more cohesive. The end
result is a stronger manuscript, one I could not have achieved without your
thoughtful direction and without the patience of the reviewers. I am deeply
thankful for their time and input.

The reports suggest a number of small but important revisions that I would
like to address individually in the following several distinct categories:

- Both reports identify the strength of the book in its contribution to the
  study of material contexts of digital text production. Reader Report 1
suggests the relationship to software studies be drawn more explicitly in the
Introduction. I was clearly influenced by software studies generally and by
Matthew Fuller's work in particular and plan to make the appropriate
clarifications in the Introduction.

- The same goes for the admittedly unintended emphasis on North American
  scholarship. Since I read widely from European sources, it would be another
suggestion easy to rectify with appropriate citation and a more explicit
intellectual lineage in the Introduction.

- Reader Report 1 suggests several specific revisions related to the verbiage
(the use of "tangled" for example) in the Introduction. Consequently, I plan
to revisit the section to further trim for any unnecessary verbiage.

- Reader Report 1 also suggests a more thorough discussion of the text's
relationship to humanism more generally. Due to length restrictions, I plan to
edit down several sections the readers found somewhat repetitive to make room
for an expanded conclusion, which will return to the subject of humanism
explicitly.

- Both readers highlight several specific typos and formatting issues in the
footnotes that I plan to rectify in a thorough edit from beginning to end. I
have hired a graduate student assistant to help clean up the footnotes and
references.

- Both readers would like to see a more precise subtitle. I do not have on in
mind yet, but I am quite receptive to the idea and will change the subtitle
when submitting the revisions, in consultation with Emily-Jane.

- Reader Report 2 asks two astute questions: first about the role of history
  ("teleological historical explanation") and second about the subversive
potential of defamiliarization. I plan to raise both of these questions in the
expanded conclusion, as is suggested in the second report ("why not return to
[the question of materialist poetics] in the conclusion?").

In addition to these changes, I plan to revise for style and clarity
throughout. Both readers commented on the high quality of prose. Yet in
a few places they noted repetition and jargon, which I could further reduce. I
have several passages in mind that could be edited down without loss to the
overall argument, which would open the way to a slightly more expanded
conclusion.

I could not have asked for a more nuanced reading of the manuscript and thank
both readers for offering encouragement and constructive critics that will
undoubtedly help the overall success of the project. Per our email exchange, I
can submit the above revisions in the first week of July.

Sincerely,
