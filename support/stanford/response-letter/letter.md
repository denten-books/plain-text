Dear Emily-Jane,

I write with gratitude for your efforts in facilitating the review of the
manuscript. The review process helped sharpen my argument, clarify the prose,
and make the structure of the book more cohesive. The end result is a stronger
manuscript, one I could not have achieved without your thoughtful direction
and without the intellectual engagement of the reviewers. I am deeply thankful
for their time and input.

The reports suggest a number of important revisions that I would like to
address individually:

- Both reports identify the strength of the book in its contribution to the
  study of material contexts of digital text production. Reader Report 1
suggests the relationship to software studies be drawn more explicitly in the
Introduction. I was clearly influenced by software studies generally and by
Matthew Fuller's work in particular and plan to make the appropriate
clarifications in the Introduction.

- The same goes for the admittedly unintended emphasis on North American
  scholarship. Since I read widely from European sources, I will address the
issue by drawing a more explicit intellectual lineage in the Introduction.

- Reader Report 1 suggests several specific revisions related to the verbiage
  (the use of "entangled" for example) in the Introduction. Consequently, I
plan to revisit the section to further trim any unnecessary jargon.

- Reader Report 1 also suggests a more thorough discussion of the text's
  relationship to humanism more generally. Due to length restrictions, I plan
to edit down several sections the readers found repetitive to make room for an
expanded Conclusion, which will return to the subject of humanism explicitly.
The total word count will remain unaffected.

- Both readers highlight several specific typos and formatting issues in the
footnotes that I plan to rectify in a thorough edit from beginning to end. I
have hired a graduate student assistant to help clean up the footnotes and
check references for accuracy.

- Both readers would like to see a more precise subtitle. I do not have one in
  mind yet, but I am receptive to the idea and will change the subtitle when
submitting the revisions, in consultation with the press.

- Reader Report 2 asks two astute questions: first about the role of history
  ("teleological historical explanation") and second about the subversive
potential of defamiliarization. I plan to raise both of these questions in the
expanded conclusion, as is suggested in the second report ("why not return to
[the question of materialist poetics] in the conclusion?").

In addition to these changes, I plan to revise for style and clarity
throughout. Both readers commented on the high quality of prose. Yet in places
they noted some repetition, which I will further reduce. I have several
passages in mind that will be edited down without loss to the overall
argument.

I could not have asked for a more nuanced reading of the manuscript and thank
both readers for offering encouragement and constructive criticism that will
undoubtedly contribute to the success of the project. Per our email exchange,
I will submit the above revisions in the first week of July.

Sincerely,
