Plain Text: The Poetics of Human-Computer Interaction

List of changes 03/28/2016:

I have made a number of major revisions to the manuscript. They are too
numerous to address individually, but all of them speak to the suggestions
found in the early reviews. Generally:

1. I have tightened the structure of the book as a whole, reducing the number
of chapters to six (including the introduction) and making sure these develop
along a clear trajectory.

2. Edited each chapter to clarify the thesis and to bring the evidence to
bear both on the chapter's thesis and on the arc of the book as a whole (per
reader's comments).

3. Introduced numerous "signposts" that help the reader along and signal the
structure of the argument throughout, as requested in the comments.

4. Reduced the number of technical terms and where necessary introduced clear
explanations accessible to a wider audience.

5. All new literary-theoretical terms are now subsumed under one concept:
computational poetics.

6. Finally, I have edited for concision and clarity of language throughout the
manuscript.
