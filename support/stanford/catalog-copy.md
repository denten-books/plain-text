This book challenges the ways we read, write, store, and retrieve information
in the digital age. Computers---electronic books and smart phones---interject
actively in our social lives. Our technological choices thus entail ethical
and ultimately political commitments. Dennis Tenen takes up today's strange
enmeshing of humans, signs, and machines to argue that our most ingrained
intuitions about texts are profoundly alienated from the physical contexts of
their intellectual production. Drawing on a rich historical archive from both
literary theory and software engineering, he makes a case for a more empowered
practice of human-computer interaction. <i>Plain Text</i> is thus a rallying
call, a frame of mind as much as a file format. Bringing computation closer to
its humanistic roots and the humanities closer to its computational realities,
it reminds us that our devices also encode specific modes of governance and
control, which must remain available to view and interpretation.
