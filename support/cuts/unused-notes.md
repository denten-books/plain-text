[^ln3-virag]: The Pollak-Virag device also proposed an "electromagnetic
vibrator" coupled to a recording "mirror-galvanometer." The authors further
specify for "the vibrator of the receiving instrument [to] vibrat[e] in harmony
with these impulses, vibrating in one direction or the other, according to
their sign and to an extent depending upon their intensity" [@pollak_means_1900].

[^ln3-derr]: See @derrida_writing_1978. I am alluding particularly to
statements like "ethnology-like any science-comes about within the element of
discourse," and "this moment was that in which language invaded the universal
problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything
became discourse-provided we can agree on this word-that is to say, when
everything became a system where the central signified, the original or
transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of
differences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and
the interplay of signification ad infinitum" (278-294).

[^ln3-alt]: "We have to think (in a completely novel way) the relation between
a science and the ideology [...] the fact that such an investigation confronts
us with the observation that every science, in the relationship it has with
ideology it emerged from, can only be thought as a 'science of ideology, would
disconcert us, were we not forewarned of the name of the *object* of knowledge,
which can only exist in the form of ideology" [@althusser_reproduction_2014,
46].

[^ln3-bottom]: For example, in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of
communication, the top-most layer of protocols and interface method is called
the "application layer" and the bottom-most layer the "physical layer"
[@peterson_computer_2007, 26-28]. Timothy Colburn and Gary Shute describe it as
being "responsible for encoding bits onto a transmission medium, whether wires,
fiber optics, or radio broadcast, in ways that maximize the transmission rate
and minimize sensitivity to noise [@colburn_abstraction_2007, 181].

[^ln3-gurevich]: Kittler mistakingly attributes "Algorithms in the World of
Bounded Resources" to Brosl Hasslacher. The author is rather Yuri Gurevich,
Principle Researcher at Microsoft Research and then a professor at the
University of Michigan. Hasslacher's essay entitled "Beyond the Turing Machine"
appeared in the same volume of collected essays, @herken_universal_1988.

[^ln3-translate2]: "In our discussion of this text we have been using an
authoritative French translation of Plato, the one published by Guillaume Bude.
In the case of *Phaedrus*, the translation is by Leon Robin. We will continue to
refer to it, inserting Greek text in parenthesis [@derrida_dissemination_1981,
71]."

[^ln3-barthes]: "The work is a fragment of substance," he writes. The work is
"moderately symbolic" where text is "radically symbolic." The work "occupies
space of books," where the text is "a process of demonstration," "experienced
only in an activity of production." He writes also that "the Text cannot stop
(for example, on a library shelf); its constitutive movement is that of cutting
across (in particular, it can cut across the work, several works)"
[@barthes_work_1978, 156-7].

[^ln1-database]: In describing his Relational Calculus Expression for Metaphor
Generation Lawrence F. Young writes that the "key to this model is the
observation that any entity can be metaphorically associated with another
entity" [@young_metaphor_1987, 312].

[^ln1-brains]: For the first view see @putnam_minds_1960 and
@fodor_language_1975. For the second view see @deutsch_quantum_1985 and
@dyson_turings_2012.

[^ln1-caveat]: The institutional distinctions between software engineering and
computer science often hinge on the extent to which the discipline pays heed
to the physical limitations of computing. As usual the situation on the ground
is much more complicated, and the boundaries between software engineering and
computer science are fast eroding. Still, North American students often have
the choice to major in Computer Science or Software Engineering. It would not
be unusual for the one faculty to be located in the School for Liberal Arts
and Science and the other in the School of Engineering. Consider also the two
major professional organizations: Institute for Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). See
@glass_comparative_1992; @parnas_software_1999; @glass_analysis_2004;
@vessey_unified_2005.

[^ln1-ceruzzi]: See @ceruzzi_computing_2012, 11 who writes that "the modern
computer is a convergence of separate streams of information handling, each
with its own rich tradition of technological history." "One could add other
antecedents such as the development of radio, motion pictures, and
photography" [@ceruzzi_computing_2012, 11].

[^ln2-chomchom]: I make this connection with many caveats and with the
acknowledgement of the complexity involved. See for example Ch. 6-8 in
@hacking_why_1975; @waller_chomsky_1977; @green_bertrand_2007, 103-43.
