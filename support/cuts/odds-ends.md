Form and Content in legal thought

When it comes to the of handbags, texts, and paintings the American legal
system grants at least four differing layers of protection. Utility patents
protect the "functional" aspects of an object. Design patents protect the
"ornamental" "look and appearance" aspects of jewelry, fashion, furniture,
beverage containers, and computer icons. Under the US Copyright Law, Section
102, copyright law protects "original works of authorship" that are "fixed in
any tangible medium of expression." Finally, the Lanham Act protects commercial
identity and distinguishes the source of commercial goods. 

Putting aside trademark law, Under the law the text cannot be a mere object. 

Language about physicality.

A derivative work is defined as "a work based upon one or more preexisting
works such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted." 17 U.S.C. § 101.

Look at a case. Threshold of originality. "non-eligibility of "textual
matter""Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc. Although a label's "graphical
illustrations" are normally copyrightable, "textual matter" is not—at least not
unless the text "aid[s] or augment[s]" an accompanying graphical illustration. 

U.S. Code: Title 35 - PATENTS

 Article One, section 8, clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution which states:

### Some old intro 

Athanasius Kircher's Universal Polygraphy George E. McCracken

Minimalism. Plain

Elegant Variation, Fowler

If you've never interacted with your computer through a text-based terminal,
understand for now that the command line is a sort of a call-and-response
dialog between you and your system. This way of interacting with computers
predates modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and is still commonly used by
professional programmers and system administrators.

More than an interface, the command line encapsulates a philosophy of
computing: write simple programs that do one thing well.

This philosophy contrasts sharply with alternative vision: where "things just
work," glossy visual interfaces. Surfaces and alienation. 

That computer interfaces entail politics is not an uncontroversial assumption
and one which will become central to the argument of my book.

Despite the ubiquity of Unix-like systems (which run a lion share of servers,
super-computers, Apple gadgets, and Android devices), the textual roots of
computing are obscured by visual

The battle for the soul of computing. Whether the internet empowers
participatory governance, deliberation, and dissent, or whether it ushers in a
new era of mass surveillance and centralized control depends crucially on which
of these two models of computing prevails.

> The machine is supplied with "tape" (the analogue of paper) The mechanization of type (media independence). With the invention of the
movable type and the typewriter the variability of hand-written script can be
normalized to a limited set of discrete characters. The process of
normalization continues today as contemporary approaches like natural language
processing and optical character recognition struggle to bring non-Western
writing systems under the umbrella of universal computability.

My short history of the distinction between form and content is necessarily
reductive. The situation on the ground was and continues to be more nuanced
than the dichotomy would suggest, with a number of reasonable positions between
extreme idealism and extreme materialism. It is enough however to give a sense
of what's at stake: not just a dry academic debate about the nature of art,
but the very capability of art (and don't necessarily think "high art" here) to
transform humanity. For Hegel, true art reaches for truth beyond visible forms,
transcending the deterministic material universe. The early formalists rejected
Hegel, emphasizing instead the text's outward formal properties as "devices"
capable of revitalizing stale metaphors and ossified ways of thinking.

# Chapter 5: Control

## Odds and Ends from intro

Drawing from the discussion between philosophers Gerard Genette and Nelson
Goodman on the nature of textual copies, I take up "reading" from the
perspective of a copy machine, which "sees" pages as monolithic images. The
machine deconstruction unveils the crisis of authenticity related to the
plummeting costs of digital reproduction. The supposedly "dead" authors
continue to draw checks from copyrighted work. Legal fictions rise to veil the
emerging affordances of textual technology.

End with unmediated thought !!!

## Attunement

We could therefore transmit a sonata by playing a violin, as
sheet-music, on a vinyl disk, recorded on tape, or by using an illegal
peer-to-peer network. In each case, the information transmitted remains more
or less the same, depending on the quality of your violin playing, the
fidelity of your speakers, or the compression ratio of your digital encoding.
It would be wrong too to consider any of these sources as somehow primal, with
others being something like "mere copies" of the original. We could for
example, start by composing music on paper. Alternatively, we could first play
a piece of music and then transcribe it into musical notation. In an extreme
but perfectly plausible case, we could compose by magnetizing a length of
ferrous tape first, and only then play the violin to reproduce what we have
"written." The medium does not know anything about the message. The way in
which we store, access, and retrieve the encoded information is determined by
the medium, however. We are the ones being shaped by the media. I do mean this
rather literally: the stage directions for Krapp's Last Tape would be very
different were Krapp writing a diary, or browsing his online social networking
profile, or if he were to embed a memory chip in his brain that was able to
store and retrieve the same messages from his thirty-nine year-old self as the
tape-recorder. The actor's body would move differently in each of these
cases—his senses and his thought would be altered in many subtle ways,
depending on the channel of communication.


## Simulation

"But if thinking consists only in writing or speaking, why shouldn't a machine
do it? Could a machine be in pain" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 17]?
Could it have internal states? "It is a travesty of the truth to say: thinking
is an activity of our mind, as writing is an activity of the
hand" [@wittgenstein_philosophical_1974, 17].

Wittgenstein's conversations with Turing about the ways by which physical
states pass into the symbolic ones and the other way around, prefigure the
operation of the universal Turing machine. The Turing machine occupies exactly
the described ambiguous state between symbol and mechanism.

This line of questioning was certainly already familiar to those students of
Wittgenstein who attended his earlier lectures at Cambridge, and who
undoubtedly have participated in his reading-related thought experiments.
Wittgenstein's reading and calculating machines were meant to challenge the
very notions of reading and calculating.

Turing returned to the problem of machine and human intelligence explicitly
[@turing_computing_1950]. Here, Turing proposes to reformulate Wittgenstein's
original question (Can machines think?) into what he calls the "imitation
game." The format would surely please his former professor: three people---a
man, a woman, and an interrogator of either sex---would communicate by
teletype. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine the
gender of the individual behind the screen. The object of the game for the
other two participants is to fool the interrogator. And here is the twist: the
part of one of the participants (not the interrogator) would be played by a
machine.

The question "Can a machine think?" becomes then, "Will the interrogator decide
wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is
played between a man and a woman?" [@turing_computing_1950, 433]. The striking
transposition of the cognitive activity (thinking) into its functional
discursive equivalent (misrepresenting one's identity in writing) echoes
Wittgenstein's playful thought experiments. The machine that thinks is a
machine that tells tall-tales. On this view, a convincing imitation of thought
is thought. We would simply not be able to prove otherwise, without peeking
behind the teletype screen to see who or what is doing the typing. In that
sense, Turing returns to Wittgenstein's refusal to locate the mark of the
cognitive within any given organ or activity. Thought is simply that which
looks (sounds, reads) like thought---it is a game that we play, and a game that
could conceivably be played by other entities, mechanical or otherwise. For our
purposes, it is interesting to note that Turing's chat-bot does not simply
compute or calculate.  It is a literary machine. It does not just imitate human
logic or speech.  Instead, it imitates (performs!) fibbing. It is able to
imagine a fictional story about an alternative identity, and ultimately to
convince its reader of the story's veracity.

In the shift from the cognitive to the discursive, Turing follows the
trajectory of Wittgenstein's thought experimentation. Moreover, the game is
tinged with distinctly sexual overtones, and in the context of an
interrogation. It is a game in which winning means transgressing either one's
gender or one's species, all the while maintaining a straight face. The
proposed language game is not simply conversational, it is suspenseful and
subversive, having the force of a mystery, a detective novel, or a legal
drama. At one point of the essay Turing answers what he calls "the argument
from consciousness," quoting one Professor Jefferson in saying that it is not
"until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts
and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that
machine equals brain---that is, not only write it but know that it had written
it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy
contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grieve when its valves fuse, be warmed
by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or
depressed when it cannot get what it wants" [@turing_computing_1950, 446].

In response Turing scripts the following conversation: 

> Interrogator: In the first line of your sonnet which reads 'Shall I compare
thee to a summer's day' would not 'a spring day' do as well or better?

> Witness: It would not scan.

> Interrogator: How about 'a winter's day.' That
would scan all right.

> Witness: Yes, but nobody want to be compared to a
winter's day.

> Interrogator: Would you say Mr.  Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?

> Witness: In a way.

> Interrogator: Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think
Mr. Pickwick would mind the comparison.

> Witness: I don't think you're serious.
By a winter's day one means a typical winter's day, rather than a special one
like Christmas [@turing_computing_1950, 447].

Add Plato. Reading is proper internalization. Interpretation is the scanned
symbol + state of the machine.

Literature as imitation game == mimesis, simulation.

Room" experiment [@searle_minds_1980].

Tie to the first two chapters. Easy multiplicity of documents.  Digitality as
something imposed from without or imposed on us! Because the book is different
it fucks with authenticity.

The possibility of text that reconfigures itself.


Although much of contemporary popular discourse on computation speaks the
language of disruption, the history of computational symbolism, of the sort I
am suggesting here, must be seen as an evolutionary trajectory.



## Engineering for Dissent

The vast machinery that brings literature to life hides from the reader's view.
Literature conceals. Even on the level of stylistics, writing well is meant to
evoke a sense of ease where it is usually the product of painstaking labor. Let
us hold on to that intuition for the duration of this chapter: writing conceals
labor.


### Algorithm 

Consider the essence of programming devices as a practice
related to the general deferment of volition by symbolic means, as in "last
will and testament" or a to-do list or a legal injunction. Someone wants you
to do something: turn left then right, buy milk, invest into real estate, or,
in the case of literature, feel compassion. Machines can be thought of as an
extension of that same practice. To "program" a rudimentary toaster, for
example, is to displace some measure of volition (I want toast) to an
inanimate object. Should I die in the process of toast-making, the toaster
will still carry the action of making toast to its logical conclusion. Common
to all of these examples is a lengthening of the cause an effect chain. Under
regular circumstances, the desire to do something produces an immediate
corresponding action in the world.  You reach for an apple. You take a bite.
"Programming" in that sense delays the execution of desire. I want toast now,
but I will program a toaster to make it tomorrow. The toaster acts as an
executor of my will.

### Technics 

theorist of science and technology, called this effect the "conditioning of
technological inheritance" [@winner_autonomous_1978, 83]. Technology may not
have politics as such, but it can entail effects comparable to the force of
law, as when for example an architect fails to design for handicapped access
[@winner_artifacts_1980]. An organization can vote to exclude the handicapped
from their buildings by political means. The technical, architectural
oversight entails the same consequences---with one major difference. The
technological decision does not always go through the same channels of
democratic deliberation as voting. It carries the force of law, without the
legal framework. The commitments stick. Once embodied in stone they are
difficult to restructure [@winner_artifacts_1980]. It is, for Winner, a soft,
suggestive kind of a determinism---the determinism of affordances.

Literary technics are similarly inherited. Much of what constitutes the
technics of writing---tools, implements, practices, and vectors of
dissemination involved---are not under the author's control. If we are to
follow Benjamin, opting out must involve more than the invention of new
literary devices, akin to photo-montage or dramatic interruption. Opting out
would involve also affecting the technics of writing. The technological
inheritance is part of the linguistic as well as the material culture. To what
extent is it possible to become a maker, an engineer of textual technology?
The allure of maker culture---the making of one's own clothes, the building
one's own furnishings, the pickling one's own conserves---can be seen as a
contemporary revolt against the tyranny of received technological inheritance.
Technics, in this sense, comprise the "tactics of daily living"
[@spengler_man_1932]. As such, they reach deep into the cultural fabric. Where
does one stop? Should literary analysis involve also the architecture of one's
desk, one's room, and bookstore?

In this light, Moreno's psychodrama, Shklovsky's estrangement, and Benjamin's
interruption can all be seen as variations on the same critical materialist
practice, aimed at the analysis and the partial disruption of received
technological inheritance. Even if we break with Marx on the primacy of
production, we are still forced to acknowledge the patent relationship between
labor and poiesis. To write is to create, and to create is to work. I am
interested here in taking the formalist research program to its logical
conclusion. The notion of literary technique identifies the kind of labor
involved. Our ability to recognize literary devices like Lubbock's "telling
the story in first person" or the "autobiographic device" points to the craft
of fiction. What we lose in the passage from the novel to the book, we gain in
the understanding of how the thing is made. This process unfolds at the
interface between idea and thing, where diegetic details internal to the
narrative world connect to extra-diegetic particulates---rules, norms,
practices, and technologies---that govern interpretation. The analysis of
technique seeks to connect the ideational content of the text with its
outward, material contexts.

Modern reader takes print for granted. Tactility. The child that swipes.
The farther removed we are historically from the object of analysis, the more
foreign the dynamics of meaning formation, and the more complete the critical
description of technique. Thus to understand the palimpsests of Medieval Spain
for example we must know something (among many things) about the physical
properties of parchment, the storage and the circulation of codices, and the
practices of reading and authorial patronage.  The modern reader has the
luxury of taking print for granted. The material conditions associated with
the Gutenberg press are simply assumed to be known and transparent. Even for
Lubbock, the book and the novel are synonymous. I would not be the first
scholar to point out the dangers of ignoring the material specificity of the
literary artifact. Johanna Drucker, Jerome McGann, Katherine Hayles, and Wendy
Chun have all made a similar case at one time or another
[@drucker_digital_2001; @mcgann_radiant_2001; @chun_enduring_2008;
@hayles_how_2012]. The analysis of the computational metaphor brings attention
to the gravity of the situation. Simulated text appears to us in the guise of
the print metaphor. By such means one system of symbolic exchange is subsumed
by another. We would like to believe, with Lubbock and Benjamin, in the power
of literary analysis to construct a bridge from ideation to material context:
from thought to thing, from novel to book, from words and sentences to shape
and design. But the simulation seals the diegetic, intra-textual world within
the device, further obscuring the relationship between the book as an idea and
the book as an object and a commodity. To mistake the illusion of print for
print prevents us from the already difficult task of examining the
particulates of received technological inheritance: "to scrutinize the
patterns that technics give to life, and to make new choices on the basis of
that critique" [@winner_autonomous_1978, 83].

Habit hides the peculiarity of our everyday interfaces with the digital word.
We read at the surface; we etch inscriptions deep within the bowels of a
machine. When enacted on the level of the physical device, formal estrangement
and interruption parallels the practice of exegesis in literary analysis. The
unpacking of literal devices that produce meaning reveals internals that
structure the reading experience made opaque through artifice and habituation.
It is at this outer level of analysis, the formalist concern with literary
technique as a system of symbolic exchange intersects with the political
concern with the technics of the book as a token exchanged on the commodities
market.

It is tempting to think of personal computers as glorified calculators. That
is often the popular image of computing, one that highlights the machine's
ability to calculate. The computer reduces culture to ones and zeroes (or so
goes the story), thereby diminishing the human experience.[^ln1-pop] There is
some truth to that position, but I would like to argue here that the
connection between computing and calculation is but a piece of a larger story.
Personal computers which govern the production of textuality today emerged
from an amalgamation of programmable machines: among them the telegraph, the
typewriter, and the calculator. Add to that list looms, music boxes, radios,
and film cameras [^ln1-ceruzzi]. These machines too left an imprint on our
everyday engagement with computational devices. The electronic book is
undoubtedly in part also a kind of a computer. But the computer also retains
traces of its literary history.

It is important to keep the intertwined material lineages of computation in
mind because each brings with it a different set of practices, values, and
priorities. As complex computational systems continue to play an ever greater
part in our lives, from affecting family relations to health and nutrition
(think social media and personal activity trackers), we are increasingly faced
with a host of conflicting choices. When building digital architectures that
are also social systems, should we privilege notions of agency or efficiency,
privacy or connectivity, elegance or complexity? These are not choices that
can be understood in purely instrumental terms. They are values external to
system architecture. The question then becomes one of ends and means. A
calculator is most efficient when operating on binary data; efficiency and
complexity are goods for the task of calculation. Humans prefer to manipulate
texts and images instead of binary data; keeping documents in simple,
human-readable formats answers the values of systematic transparency and
sustainability. What values are embodied in the electronic book? The passive
voice and our inability to answer the question directly points to the root of
the problem.
