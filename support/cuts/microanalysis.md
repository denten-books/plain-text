### Microanalysis 

The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC),
the organization responsible for the controversial Common Core standards being
implemented in schools across the United States today, promotes close reading
as "thorough," "methodical," and "analytical" practice that "enables students
to reflect on the meanings of individual words and sentences; the order in
which sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the
text, which ultimately leads students to arrive at an understanding of the
text as a whole" [@parcc_parcc_2012, 7]. The general movement here is from
"text" on the page to "work" (text as a whole, in the language of the report).
