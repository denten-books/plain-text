The book ends with a short conclusion expounding a theory of
microanalysis---the closest possible kind of reading---which brings the
material particulates engaged in the construction of meaning under the purview
of interpretation.[^ln-iarkho] Where distant reading and macroanalysis
constitute the study of mediation between readers and text aggregates (like
canons, genres, corpora, libraries, and archives) microanalysis examines
mediation at the level of physical minutiae. The instruments of microanalysis
coincide with algorithmic tools that reveal patterns and data structures
inaccessible to the naked eye. Microanalysis may also require facility with a
screwdriver, a binding needle, or a soldering iron: sharp tools that help to
expose structures of governance and control routinely embedded into modern
literary devices.
