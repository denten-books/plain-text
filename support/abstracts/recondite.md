For Sarai, Delhi

Text is a prevalent type of digital data. We have yet to come to terms,
however, with the fundamental alienation implicit in its apprehension. Unlike
paper or punch card, solid state and magnetic storage comprise sub-sensory
media, not directly accessible to human perception. Using materials from the
history of information technology in the twentieth century, I outline the
historical disappearance of digital inscription. The textual sign fractures, I
argue, to diverge at the archival site (hard drive) from the site of its
projection (screen). What we see is almost never what we get. A substantial
gap separates screens from storage devices. Forces of capital and control
finally exploit the opaque nature of the medium. The gap conceals surveillance
and censorship mechanisms, which at the extreme threaten illiteracy
