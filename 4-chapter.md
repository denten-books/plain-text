## Chapter 4: Letter at Hand
`reading, writing, home, media being`

Right away let us dissmiss the common misonception about the origins of the
QWERTY keyboard. It did not gain that arrangement because. It is also not true
that other layout necessarily achieve faster speeds like Dvorak or . This
chapter is about keyboards however. It won't be a totalizing history, as
before. Why so important? Why so not important now?

That technologies of the written word are somehow corrupting our native
cognitive capabilities, that the humanity (in certain parts of the world, that
is) is becoming dependent on externalized cognitive aids, and that such
dependence has wide-ranging social repercussions, are worries that have
permeated Western popular culture since the days of Socrates. "I see within us
all (myself included) the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind
of self," Richard Foreman writes in an essay that accompanies his play *The
Pancake People*. This new self is shallow, containing "less and less of an
inner repertory of dense cultural inheritance" [@foreman_pancake_2005].
Nicholas Carr echoes these words in his widely-cited 2008 article for the
*Atlantic Monthly*, writing that "over the past few years I've had an
uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my
brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory." "The deep
reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle," Carr writes and
concludes to suggest that online search engines are making us stupid
[@carr_is_2008]. Lionel Trilling has described this reoccurring "anxiety about
the machine" as "the sense of something intervening between man and his own
organic endowment," and considered it "a powerful element in the modern
consciousness, an overt and exigent issue in our culture"
[@trilling_sincerity_1972, 127-8].

I pull on these variegated strains of related thought to assemble a bricolage
of ideas that gives rise to media being---an artificial creature born out of
the dialectical tension between mind and body, internal and external, immanence
and transcendence, matter and spirit. However arbitrary the boundaries of
Cartesian dualism may be, they lie at the fault lines between something vital
and something human on the one side and something matter-bound and inorganic on
the other. One does not have to make these boundaries essential or
deterministic to perceive their perpetual importance in the conversation about
knowledge and technology. In this way, Friedrich Nietzsche spoke of the modern
man who "drags around with him a huge quantity of indigestible stones of
knowledge." For Nietzsche the modern condition was defined by a profound
incongruence between "interior" and "exterior" [@nietzsche_untimely_1997, 78].
He writes, "We moderns, have nothing whatever of our own; only by replenishing
and cramming ourselves with the ages, customs, arts, philosophies, religions,
discoveries of others do we become anything worthy of notice, that is to say
walking encyclopedias." These encyclopedias he calls "handbook[s] of inward
culture for outward barbarians" [@nietzsche_untimely_1997, 79]. Nietzsche's
metaphor is one of cultural "indigestion." The rocks that rattle within
represent the detritus of knowledge that is not somehow fully assimilated into
the individual psyche. In this Nietzsche also mirrors the concern of Plato's
*Phaedrus*, where Thamus, the king of Thebes, is shown to be weary of not fully
internalized and undigested knowledge. Responding to Theuth, the great
god-inventor who brought Egyptians the gifts of arithmetic, geometry,
astronomy, draughts, and writing among other arts, the king worries that
writing in particular will harm rather than help his people. When it came to
letters, Thamus comments:

> Most ingenious Theuth [...] the father of letters, [you] have been led by
your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they
really possess. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of
those who learn to use it, because they will not practise their memory. Their
trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of
themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have
invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils
the appearance  of wisdom, not true wisdom for they will read many things
without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are
for the most part ignorant [...] [@plato_plato:_1999, 563-4].

### 5.4 Rereading

What does it mean to "have read" a book in this light? Surely, when someone
says "I too have read this book" they mean something more than the mechanical
action of turning pages and moving one's eyes from left to right in a
sequential manner. The blunt act of purchasing the book is also somewhat
besides the point. Benjamin implies a deeper connection. To have read is to
internalize, to understand, and to form a mental image or opinion. But what
exactly is internalized? It cannot be the whole text, verbatim. By reading we
mean something other than rote memorization. In his *Blue and Brown Books*,
written somewhere between the *Tractatus* and *Philosophical Investigations*,
Ludwig Wittgenstein gives the example of a child who is asked to read, but who
instead regurgitates the text from memory. Wittgenstein further asks his
readers to imagine an experimental "human reading machine," which like the
child "reads" by making sounds which sometimes do and sometimes do not
correspond with the printed word. An observer not familiar with the mechanism
of this experimental "reader," could be fooled into thinking the machine is
reading. The coincidence between sound and word remains accidental, however. We
would remain skeptical of this activity as reading even if our machine were to
begin to correlate letters to appropriate sounds consistently
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120-1].

In his characteristically cryptic manner, Wittgenstein explains his thought
experiment by making yet another analogy:

> If A tries to make B believe that he is able to read Cyrillic script,
> cheating him by learning a Russian sentence by heart and then saying it while
> looking at the printed sentence, we may certainly say that A knows he is
> pretending, and that his not reading is characterized by a particular
> personal experience [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120-1].

But suppose the man really does know how to read Russian, although when he
reads he has a peculiar feeling of knowing the words by heart. Should we regard
his personal experience as the criterion distinguishing between reading and not
reading in that case? And again, Wittgenstein expects us to answer in the
negative. It seems then, that the functional performance of reading cannot
determine the behavior alone. In each case, we had to check for the appropriate
internalized mental state. Wittgenstein writes, "We here envision two
mechanisms, the internal workings of which we can see, and this internal
working is the real criterion for a person's reading or not reading. But in
fact no such mechanisms are known to us in these cases"
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120].

As it turns out, the mental state alone is also insufficient to describe
reading definitively. Here, Wittgenstein asks us to imagine a person under the
influence of drugs who is shown a set of discrete strings composed of
nonsensical characters. When shown some random string of nonsensical characters
like `$%^&*`, for example, the drugged patient imagines he is reading some
English word, like "above" or "stair," as if the typographical characters were
meaningful. As far as the patient is concerned, he is reading. All the
structural attributes of the action are there---the proper region of his brain
is receiving stimulation; he follows the text with his eyes from left to right;
and silently mouths the words. But this too is unacceptable: the patient merely
imagines that he is reading [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 122].

In this way, neither the internal nor the external descriptions of the action
seem adequate to encompass everything we mean by reading. And yet we do have a
relatively clear picture of what reading properly entails, what it looks like,
what it sounds like, how to do it, and how to teach others to do it. In
building this chain of deferring analogies (from the reading child to the drug
induced reading hallucination) we are acting as though "we had tried to find
the real artichoke by stripping it of its leaves," writes Wittgenstein
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 125]. Instead, the leaves themselves, when bundled
together, *are* the artichoke. At which point of peeling the artichoke does the
artichoke disappear into leafy particulates? It is a patently misguided
question. The question of cognition, for Wittgenstein, fails in a similar way.
Our mistake lies in attempting to reduce cognitive activity like "reading" to a
set of either external (functional) attributes or internal (formal) mental
structures. Yet neither of these are sufficient. Reading happens in the head
and on the page [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16]. Wittgenstein explains that:

> In the consideration of our problems one of the most dangerous ideas is the
> idea that we think with, or in, our heads [...] 'Thinking takes place in the
> head" really means only 'the head is connected with thinking."---Of course
> one says also 'I think with my pen' and this localization is at least as good
> [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 116].

In refusing to resolve the tension between functional (or behaviorist) and
formal (or structuralist) accounts of cognition, Wittgenstein's thought
experiments suggest a model of textual activity that sees reading and writing
as a movement between innate mental structures their external, media-bound
representations. Although Wittgenstein does not explain it in these terms,
reading and writing for him happens at the interface of mental and physical
boundaries. In other words, reading and writing proper involve a measure of
"correct" correlation between internal mind states and external paper-and-ink
states. This correlation I take to resemble Benjamin's "staging of fate." The
moment of interface, on the stage of a bookshelf, is what unites the history of
the book with the history of one's conciousness. It is exactly the encounter
between the collective and the private. What "I know" and "we know" meets and
intertwines on the page.

To have read a book therefore involves a certain physical facility with the
text: in the way its structure can, with much practice and repetition, become
readily available to the "mind's eye." I "see" a particular thought or image in
relationship to the rest of the structure. What was then a series of unrelated
vignettes, my mind stitches into some coherent whole. That structure is not in
the mind alone: I have a "feeling" about the location of that thought on paper.
The cognitive facility with the work as a mental construct accompanies a
applied manipulation of the text as a physical artifact. I will "leaf through"
a familiar book. I may not yet know what I am looking for, but I remember where
the "sign posts" are. The mental facility of "having read something" is however
curtailed by the limits of human memory. Even after teaching the same text for
several years in a row, I have to "refresh" my knowledge of its contents. This
sort of knowledge becomes easier with repetition, but I am also painfully aware
of its impermanence.

Abandoning a text for several decades means to lose some facility in navigating
it mentally and physically. I still "have read it," but with time "having read"
begins to mean less than before. That structures of "having internalized"
become a memory of past internalized structures.[^ln5-james-memory] And that is
a difficult thing to admit to oneself. We expect or at least talk as if
knowledge has a semi-permanent cognitive purchase within the individual. But,
fundamentally, I also must accept that knowledge available to my "mind's eye"
constitutes only a small fraction of the things I can know "ready at hand."
Most of the things I know and have read are available to me on my book shelves,
in my notebooks, online, and on my hard drives. I do not know them in a sense
of remembering them---I know them in the sense of being able to find the
information if needed, to evaluate sources, and to recall a cascade of related
past (formed) mental reactions. I suspect that most things I know and have read
come to me in that condensed, externalized form. The amount of ideas accessible
to me "at hand" must vastly outnumber the ideas in the "mind's eye." The hand
and the inner eye work together to enter into what Barbara Herrnstein Smith
calls "a circuit of reciprocal effectivity" [@smith_belief_1997, 54], except,
in this case, both the speaker and the listener, reader and writer, are found
in one of the same person.

### 5.4 Ethno-Psychology

In thinking of cognitive structures inside and outside the natural brain-bound
limits of the mind, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein anticipate a late-twentieth
century turn towards "extended" and "situated" cognition in the fields of
psychology, cognitive studies, and most relevantly for this book, in the field
of human-computer interaction (HCI). Donald Norman, a prominent figure in HCI,
traces the concern with what he calls "cognitive artifacts" to the work of the
German physiologist, Willhelm Wundt (1832--1920 who, among other ideas,
pioneered the notion of "folk psychology [@norman_designing_1991, 3]" in the
early 1910s. Wundt himself credits the creation of "folk" or, better yet,
"ethno-" or "cultural psychology (*Völkerpsychologie*) to Moritz Lazarus
(1824--1903) and Heymann Steinthal (1823--99), German--Jewish philosophers and
philologists of an earlier generation, both now for the most part forgotten in
this lineage [@danziger_origins_1983].

In their programmatic 1860 introduction to the first issue of *Journal for
Linguistics and Folk Psychology* (*Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und
Sprachwissenschaft*), Lazarus and Steinthal declare a new discipline of study
which combines "physical" and "mental ehtnology" [@lazarus_einleitende_1860,
1]. Elsewhere, in search of making the Hegelian notion of *Geist* more
concrete, the authors separate the Hegelian spirit into what they call they
call purely "mental elements," like views, convictions, opinions, thoughts and
feelings, and "symbolic embodiments of thought," like art work, documents,
literature, built structures of all kinds, and industrial products. These
"contain the objectified spirit in the narrow sense," as "*Geist* transferred
into an object," which then has the potential to "arouse subjective [mental]
activity" [@lazarus_einige_1865, 53-4].[^ln4-stein] In this way, "the movement
of ideas includes an organic system for the generation of intellectual tools
[*Erzeugung von geistigen Werkzeugen*], which help and reinforce one another"
[@lazarus_einleitende_1860, 18]. In this light, cultural psychology emerges as
a "third science" between natural sciences and history, "mediating" between
universal law and individual human freedom [@lazarus_einleitende_1860, 19]. For
Lazarus and Steinthal, cultural psychology offers something like a "physiology
of human history." In contrast to the prevailing racial and Darwinist
explanations of historical process, which arranged cultures along a
hierarchical evolutionary pyramid (with Western civilization at its
pinnacle),[^ln4-kalmar] the authors view national psychology as a
historically-contingent and neutral interplay between individual mental states
and externalized, common, material representations of spiritual life
[*Darstellung des geistigen Inhaltes*] [@lazarus_einleitende_1860;
@lazarus_einige_1865].

[^ln4-kalmar]: The anthropologist Ivan Kalmar calls this view "ethnocentric
evolutionism" [@kalmar_volkerpsychologie_1987, 680].

In the twenty volumes of the journal's existence, Lazarus and Steinthal wrote
several programmatic pieces similar to the ones quoted above, but, perhaps due
to their marginalized academic status, they rarely had the chance to put the
proposed research program into practice. Their legacy remains in the
articulation of *Völkerpsychologie*, which points to a systematic study of both
the social and the material aspects of shared mental life. Scholars involved in
reconstructing the intellectual legacy of Lazarus and Steinthal usually
emphasize the first of these directions, placing them early within an explicit
lineage of social thought that connects to Georg Simmel, Max Weber, and Martin
Buber on the German side, to the French sociology school of Émile Durkheim and
Marcel Mauss, to the Soviet socio-linguistics of Alexander Veselovsky,
Alexander Potebnja, Mikhail Bakhtin; and to the birth of Anglo-American
anthropology through Bronisła Malinowski and Franz Boaz
[@danziger_origins_1983; @kalmar_volkerpsychologie_1987; @kohnke_four_1990;
@greenwood_volkerpsychologie_1999; @diriwachter_volkerpsychologie_2004].
Remarkably, all of the above mentioned scholars, many of whom started
significant intellectual schools of their own, mention the *Völkerpsychologie*
of Lazarus, Steinthal, and Wundt as an important early influence.

Much more work needs to be done to recover the intellectual legacy of
*Völkerpsychologie*. The Canadian cultural historian and anthropologist Ivan
Kalmar, who was one of the earliest contemporary voices to begin that work,
laments that Lazarus and Steinthal would have been much better remembered by
anthropologists today had they described their research program as a type
anthropology, instead of psychology. Yet he explains also that the authors
explicitly rejected anthropology as too "physiological" and too "climatic" to
provide sufficient grounds for a study of *Volksgeist.* Their explicit aim was
to make the "total of inner experience comprehensible"
[@kalmar_volkerpsychologie_1987, 673-4]. They therefore considered cognates
like "mental ethnology" before settling on *Völkerpsychologie*. Cultural
psychology therefore reflects a concern with both "subjective" and "objective"
life of the spirit, in a mutual dialogue between a person's inner life, as a
sequence of impressions and ideas, and the sum total of "concrete" and
"objectified" or externalized manifestations of that inner life (like documents,
buildings, and commercial products" [@lazarus_einige_1865, 53-55; also quoted
in @kalmar_volkerpsychologie_1987, 679]. This model of culture itself relies on
recursion, by which the common (*das Allgemeine*) and the personal (*das
Persönliche* are throughout intertwined (*durchaus gleichgemischt*)
[@lazarus_einige_1865, 55].

Technology plays an interesting role in this circle of internalizing and
externalizing. Lazarus writes that "tools and machines appear between the
extremes" of "symbolic personifications" (art works and documents) on the one
hand and purely spiritual elements, like beliefs and convictions, on the other.
The Spirit is thereby "objectified" through technology to attain "lasting
efficacy" (*Wirksamkeit*) conditioned through continual "knowledge of use"
(*Kenntniß des Gebrauchs*) [@lazarus_einige_1865, 55].

I construct this brief genealogy of
technological skepticism of a particular kind to note that all of the above
example contains within them a bifurcated model, that puts some notion of inner
"natural mind" into an often problematic relationship with technologies of
externalized cognitive augmentation.

### Extended Cognition

In this concern with the externalized forms of private thought, Lazarus and
Steinthal anticipate not only the turn to collective intelligence in the end of
the ninetieth century (CHECK ON THAT), but to extended cognition at the end
of the twentieth. The so-called sMoscow school of psychology, *Völkerpsychologie* 

note only that the texts quoted above already contain the kernel of the
extended mind hypothesis. Norman, writing in the 1990a traces a direct lineage
between himself and Wundt through the Soviet social-historical schools of the
1920s, as reflected in the works of Leontev, Luria, and Vygotsky--not to the
collective psychology of Alexander Luria, Lev Vygotsky, and Kurt Lewin
translated into English until late 1970s and early 1980s.[^ln4-halbwachs] And
Hutchins and cognitive artifacts by Dan Norman. Hypothesis of extended
cognition. Effect on the study of literature.

The Hypothesis of Extended Cognition (HEC) The hypothesis of extended cognition
(HEC) holds that certain cognitive processes can be viewed as extending beyond
the boundaries of the human body into their physical, social, and symbolic
environments. Andy Clark and David Chalmers suggest an example involving Otto
and Inga: two individuals on their way to an art exhibition. Inga remembers the
location of the museum by memory. Otto suffers from Alzheimer's, and must
consult his notebook to find the exhibition. Clark and Chalmers posit that the
information in Otto's notebook is the same as the information in Inga's head.
And were the notebook literally inside Otto's brain somehow, we would have no
trouble equating the two cognitive acts of remembrance: Inga simply remembers
how to get to the exhibition, while Otto incorporates some cognitive aids to
facilitate his memory.6

For the externalists—Clark, Chalmers, Wilson, and others—the differences
between Otto's and Inga's case are superficial: both are engaged in essentially
identical cognitive tasks of recollection. On this view Otto's usage of a
notebook constitutes something like a unified cognitive system, which
encompasses parts of Otto's brain and parts of the physical pen-and-paper
apparatus. The pen and the notebook simply constitute the material or
technological elements of the system, enabling the storage and the retrieval of
information. Similarly, the notation itself—the alphabet by which Otto is able
to encode the needed information—can be seen as a symbolic and social component
of the system. Not just Otto's notes, but all language, according to the
externalists, serves as a kind of ready-made mental scaffolding, which enables
a level of computation and analysis otherwise unavailable to primates.7 The
study of cognition therefore must expand beyond the skin-and-bone boundary of
the human brain to include the social, symbolic, and material (technological)
artifacts involved in human thought. To study Otto's brain is to also to study
the pen, the notebook, and the notes Otto takes when he uses these things to
remember the details of his appointment.  In another paradigmatic example of
HEC-based analysis, Edwin Hutchins examines the workings of a commercial
airliner in flight, showing "how the cockpit system performs the cognitive task
of computing and remembering a set of correspondences between airspeed and wind
configuration."8 The system-level view of cognition draws attention to the
combination of mechanical, electronic, and biological processes responsible for
the flow and storage of information within the plane's cockpit. The system can
be said to "remember" its speeds, writes Hutchins. It "computes," "controls,"
"makes use of representations" and otherwise distributes cognitive labor. Were
we to ask, "Who is landing the plane?" we would expect Hutchins to answer "the
cockpit system as a whole."9

Two types of extension The opponents of HEC reject the view of cognition as
anything other than what goes on inside the body and the brain. Fred Adams and
Ken Aizawa in particular have staked out a clearly delineated position in
defense of what the authors call "contingent intracranialism." On this view,
the "mark of the cognitive" is located squarely within the brain, as a matter
of a contingent empirical fact.10 To prove their point, Adams and Aizawa
compare our intuitions about human tool use and animal digestion. Imagine
someone using loping shears to trim a bush, for example. Although the activity
of "trimming-a-bush" as a whole seems to be a combined product of human
muscular contraction and the mechanical capabilities of the loping shears, we
would not be compelled to think of loping shears as "extended muscular
contraction."

By contrast, something like arachnoid digestion constitutes a digestive process
that is truly external. Arachnoid digestion happens outside of the spider's
body literally: the spider regurgitates digestive enzymes into or unto its
prey. What happens in our stomachs happens outside the strict corporeal
boundaries of the spider. We could therefore meaningfully talk about "extended
digestion" when it comes to spiders. But, for Adams and Aizawa, Otto's
notebook-reliant memory looks less like arachnoid digestion and more like the
discrete movement of muscle against the mechanism of the garden shears. Otto is
not thinking literally outside of his head. Like the man with the garden
shears, he is using a tool to compliment the exercise of some internal,
biological function. But it seems to me that this line of reasoning is simply
begging the question. Adams and Aizawa merely appeal to a scientific standard
of internalism, where the scientific standard is precisely the thing that is
being called into question. One gets the sneaking suspicion that the argument
is really about definitions, with one side appealing to common sense and the
other to scientific standards.11 My own suspicions about HEC rise from the
observation that the existentialist argument seems to contain two distinct
propositions about the nature of cognitive extension, each carrying distinct
implications for practical analysis of complex cognitive tasks. Let's return to
the example suggested by Hutchins in "How a Cockpit Remembers its Speed". We
begin by noting that a plane is a curiously anthropomorphic structure. It has
something like a head, a tail, and a belly: cockpit windows where we would
expect eyes, and a hole where we would expect to see an anus. It is thus easy
to imagine this structure as sentient somehow. We may for example, say "it
thinks, it sees," or "it eats" without much stretching of the imagination.

### Critique of Extended Cognition

Suppose then, instead of discussing a complex, high-level biological process
such as cognition, we were to talk about digestion. The hypothesis of extended
digestion would then hold that digestion is not limited by the human body, and
that it may be seen as a systematic property of the plane as a whole. On this
view, the plane—its service staff and food storage mechanisms—all participate
in digestion, defined by the uptake of food, its distribution, and the disposal
of waste. We may even go as far as to say that digestion is something that
happens in the belly of the plane. Food is conveyed within by some mechanical
means, it is then divvied up among the passengers, processed, and expelled in
bulk with the emptying of the airplane's holding tanks.

How far are we willing to take the proposition of airplane digestion? Not very
far at all, I would argue. Clearly, this is not digestion as we know it. It has
some structural affinities to animal digestion (the food is conveyed within,
broken down, expelled) along with important structural differences (the food it
is not metabolized, for example). Thus a strong claim to airplane digestion
must be rejected as an imprecise metaphor, by which the concept of a given
process is transferred from one entity to another by structural similarity (the
same would hold true were we to consider fueling as a type of digestion).

Such metaphoric transference may prove to be conceptually useful in certain
types of analysis, as when the airlines want to improve the timely feeding of
their passengers, for example. "The plane needs to eat," they might say. "Our
staff has to feed the plane in a timely fashion." But, the metaphor strains
under scrutiny. We may as well stick to a more exacting description of the
process. In any case, what we have done here is extend the natural concept of
"digestion" (in its ordinary meaning) to an inanimate entity, or a system of
entities that includes biological and non-biological components. Furthermore,
we have discovered that such a functional analogy is subject to confusion by
metaphor.

Extrapolating from these observations, we should be able to draw the same
conclusions about cognition. The cockpit may look as if it is "'remembering its
speed," but its "memory"' is a mere metaphor. The two processes— human
remembrance and whatever happens in the cockpit—never reach full equivalence.
The metaphor does not inspire our full commitment. It is an alluring metaphor
however, particularly because the cockpit's shape and location (in relation to
the body of the plane) remind us of the human head. It might be a useful
metaphor for analyzing the information flow within the cockpit, but it is
imprecise when it comes to understanding human cognition as such. All that is
meant by human cognition does not map precisely unto the cognition as applied
to the airplane cockpit. Clearly some parts of the original definition are
simply left out—the firing of neurons and the transmission of glutamate, GABA,
or dopamine. Some aspect of the cockpit's operation may be likened to those
biological processes, but nobody would hold that they are fully equivalent.

There is a possibility of another, weaker claim to extended digestion, to
continue our example. The conveyance of food from the grocery shelves to the
mouth of an individual airplane passenger may well be an important part of that
passenger's digestive process. We are no longer talking about digestion in a
metaphoric sense, as we did when thinking about the belly of the plane. I mean
now literal digestion, as in "the breaking down of food." In that sense, there
is no reason for us to view our own digestion as much different from a
spider's. The preparation of food external to the human body could be viewed
much in the same way as we view arachnoid digestion. Both are external
processes evolved to aid in the break-down of tissues otherwise difficult to
digest internally. The spider regurgitates enzymes, where we use a knife, a
fork, a cheese grater, or any other kitchen implement for that matter.
Following similar logic, we may view the catering company responsible for
preparing the airline food as part of that extended digestion system. The
cooks, the forks, and the stewards all literally facilitate the break-down and
the conveyance of food into the passenger's belly. More than a thought
experiment, the understanding of digestion in this extended sense could be
quite useful in certain types of analysis, as in identifying the cause of
foodborne illness, for example. In the previous case we were making a
biomorphic analogy between two distinct processes: the digestion of food and
the fuelling or the supply of the plane. But now, we are actually trying to
expand the original concept of digestion, usually thought to be an internal
process, to include all sort of external mechanisms. We are no longer making an
imprecise analogy. Our position is one of true digestive externalism.  But in
expanding the definition of digestion outwards, we run into what I would like
to call "the problem of arbitrary limits." Let us return to cognition for the
moment. In thinking about the cognitive tasks involved in landing a plane, we
began by including the cockpit instrumentation and the communication between
the pilots into the equation. But why limit ourselves to the plane in our
analysis? The runway participates in the landing, and so do the dispatchers in
the control tower. We may then say the airport system as a whole is landing the
plane. That too seems to be an arbitrary boundary. The dispatchers rely on a
global network which memorizes, computes, and predicts landing parameters. At
the limits of this query is unbridled monism. The activity of "landing a plane"
begins to lose its meaning when the activity of the pilot is coupled with the
entire universe.

I conclude then, to say that extending the concept of cognition to the cockpit
of the plane is subject to the limit problem. The disavowal of the body and/or
brain as the natural boundary of cognition leads to an arbitrary placement of
yet another boundary. We have simply substituted the natural physical limits of
the brain with those of the airplane cockpit. And nothing holds us back from
pushing the boundaries of cognition ever outward. Every boundary seems
artificial, and every system seems to be a part of a larger system that could
be seen as participating in the cognitive task at hand. In embracing the
extension hypothesis literally, we have traded metaphoric imprecision for the
problem of arbitrary limits.
