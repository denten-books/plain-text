## Chapter 4: Recursive Encounters with Oneself
`document, vector, archive, media being`

### 4.1 Librarians of Self

Every year, Krapp, the titular character of Samuel Beckett's *Krapp's Last
Tape*, records and listens to himself speak from the past. The play begins on
one such occasion. Krapp, who is just turning sixty-nine, reaches for box
three, spool five. The recording contains a monologue of his thirty-nine year
old self, responding to yet another, decade old reel---which means the action
of the play reasonably spans at least forty years.

For theater audiences in 1958 (the date of the play's first production) the
reel-to-reel recorder was still somewhat of a novelty item, but already
beginning to make its way into American and European living rooms. These
devices were expensive, costing the equivalent of thousands of dollars (when
adjusted for inflation). The expense of the device contributes to the image of
Krapp as a man of independent means, who has perhaps fallen on some hard times:
he is wearing ill-fitting trousers, a black sleeveless coat, and a "surprising
pair of dirty white boots, size ten at least, very narrow and pointed"
[@beckett_complete_2006, 215]. Personal tape recorders manufactured by
companies like Sony, Ampex, and Phillips began appearing on the market in the
late 1940s and were universally marketed as "recorders" and not merely
"playback devices" or "players." They often aimed to engage a family's instinct
for archival preservation, with slogans like: "Remember their laughter forever,
record it on 'Magnetic Ribbon,'" (from a 1946 advertisement for Soundmirror
recorder by Brush) and "Make your cherished moments will last the years" (from
a 1959 Dupont advertisement for Mylar tape). Where the earlier materials
targeted radio broadcasting and office use, by 1950s the settings depicted on
personal tape recorder advertisements shift location to spaces in the domestic,
familial, and private spheres. The tape recorder at the time was offered as a
device to record childhood birthdays, graduations, holidays, and school
performances. "Fun times last a lifetime," declares another advertisement from
Dupont. "Record this Christmas forever!" and "When there's no second chance,
record with Acetate base tape!" The composite photographs in these
advertisements often showed a device in use with a fairly large microphone,
which upstages the recorder as the locus of family attention. Finally, the
adverts suggest not just a means of preservation, but a mode of personal
archiving practice. An advertisement for Apex circa 1963 shows a row of neatly
arranged and labelled reels on a shelf, bragging "Who came up with the best way
to label your tapes?" Another ad for Bell's Tape Transporter, circa 1959,
depicts a couple in their living room, relaxing around a tape recorder and near
a shelf-like piece of furniture holding reels and equipment in neat wooden
compartments. "Build your own library of stereo tapes," reads the
slogan.[^ln4-dupont]

Is it still a monologue when one talks to his own images from the past? Krapp
has changed. He no longer feels fully congruent with his former self, "that
stupid bastard" [@beckett_complete_2006, 221]. He sometimes has to consult a
dictionary to understand what the voice on the tape says. At other times he
cannot read his own handwriting. And often he simply loathes the voice from the
past:

> Hard to believe I was ever that young whelp. The voice! Jesus! And the
> aspirations! [*Brief laugh in which KRAPP joins*] To drink less, in
> particular. [*Brief laugh of Krapp alone*.] ...hard to believe I was ever as
> bad as that. Thank God that's all done with anyway [@beckett_complete_2006,
> 221].

Who is Krapp laughing with? There are at least three of him present on stage:
the voice on the tape, the one who speaks and records now, and the implied one,
to whom the recording is addressed. We do not, as a matter of everyday life,
perceive our conciousness to be divided in such a way. Whatever is meant by the
"unity of conciousness," it is here created through literary conceit, and on
the stage, with an aid of a tape recorder. Beckett reminds us of the fragility
of that illusion. The work (*Krapp's Last Tape*) gives unity to the
multiplicity of individual character representations. Within the play's
fictional world, that role is played by magnetic storage media that physically
connects Krapp in time with his past and future selves. The tape recorder
functions to reflect Krapp's image back to Krapp and in the process, to record
the encounter for later reevaluation and re-recording.[^ln4-recursive] In this
light, the specificity of the tape as a medium is not terribly important. The
story would be similarly plausible were it set a century prior, using a
conventional pen-and-ink diary as its medium, or written some decades later
under the title of *Krapp's Latest Social Media Platform*.[^ln4-boring] The
play exposes storage media as being inextricably enmeshed in the narcissistic
activity of human culture making. The seeming unity of Krapp's consciousness
and, indeed, the stage appearance of consciousness itself, are aided by the use
of paper and tape. The device on the stage creates the illusion of Krapp's
inner life; it allows the author to shift the narrative in time; it multiplies
and refracts the images of the main character of the play. The reel-to-reel
player functions both as audience and actor: alternatively listening and
speaking, recording and transmitting. Ultimately, Krapp's fate is not only
indexically linked to the tape-recorder, it is created by and for this
technological medium. The reader knows Krapp is Krapp because all of them
appear under the same eponymous literary umbrella.

But just as storage media creates Krapp, Beckett shows Krapp in the process of
shaping his collection. Krapp is a librarian and an archivist of sorts.
Krapp's elaborate filing system, by which he stores and organizes his
recordings, confirms his archival role. He goes through several of his filing
cabinets, "peering and poking at the boxes" [@beckett_complete_2006, 216] as if
to check the integrity of his collection, before settling on the tape from his
thirty-ninth birthday ("Box Three, Spool Five" he says with relish.) The
cardboard storage boxes, the drawers, the ledger, and the very word
itself---"spool," "spooool"---make him exceedingly happy. Beckett presents
Krapp's archival activity as a kind of a Chaplinesque comedy routine, with
erotic overtones:

> Krapp remains a moment motionless, heaves a great sigh, looks
at his watch, fumbles in his pockets, takes out an envelope, puts it back,
fumbles, takes out a small bunch of keys, raises it to his eyes, chooses a key,
gets up and moves to front of table. He stoops, unlocks first drawer, peers
into it, feels about inside it, takes out a reel of tape, peers at it, puts it
back, locks drawer, unlocks second drawer peers into it, feels about inside it,
takes out a large banana, peers at it, locks drawer, puts keys back in his
pocket. He turns, advances to edge of stage, halts, strokes banana, peels it,
drops skin at his feet, puts end of banana in his mouth and remains motionless,
staring vacuously before him [...] He treads on skin, slips, nearly falls,
recovers himself, stoops and peers at skin and finally pushes it, still
stooping, with his foot over the edge of the stage into pit. He resumes his
pacing, finishes banana, returns to table, sits down, remains a moment
motionless, heaves a great sigh, takes keys from his pockets, raises them to
his eyes, chooses key, gets up and moves to front of table, unlocks second
drawer, takes out a second large banana, peers at it, locks drawer, puts back
his keys in his pocket, turns, advances to the edge of stage, halts, strokes
banana, peels it, tosses skin into pit, puts an end of banana in his mouth and
remains motionless, staring vacuously before him [@beckett_complete_2006, 216].

These stage directions exude a nervous energy one would expect before an erotic
encounter: Krapp is being clumsy and excited. Box Three, Spool Five does indeed
contain an account of a past romance, but the encounter Krapp is excited about
is with the archive---that is with externalized representations of his own
self. The suggestive stroking of the banana punctuates the onanistic nature of
Krapp's archival activity. If Krapp is a librarian, he is a librarian of a
particular kind: a librarian of the self.

Let us envision Krapp's archiving habits for a moment. The stage directions
specify a den and a small table containing two drawers that open towards the
audience. The table holds a tape-recorder, a microphone, and "a number of
cardboard boxes containing reels of recorded tapes" [@beckett_complete_2006,
215]. How many reels are there? At the time of the play's action, Krapp is
sixty-nine years old. Tape reels of the time held somewhere between twenty and
sixty of audio recording per side, depending on the length and thickness of
tape, and on the speed (inches per second) of the recording device
[@utz_introduction_2003, 123-4]. Reels came in sizes ranging from three to
seven inches in diameter and were often sold in flat rectangular storage
sleeves, somewhere between 1/4 and 2 inches thick, depending on the tape
format. Reading from the ledger, Krapp counts at least nine boxes. Spool five,
recorded on his thirty-ninth birthday, is found in box three. Given modest
storage-box capacity, we would expect at least fifteen to twenty spools per
box. Which means that after more than forty years of recording, Krapp would
have accumulated at least several hundred reels, and at least as many hours of
recording (assuming, conservatively, that his recording sessions lasted around
a reel each).

Krapp's collection has seen better times, for even the archetypal librarian of
the self must face the problems faced by any librarian. The theoretically
perfect recursion of the medium strains under practical scrutiny:
classification systems deteriorate, descriptions lose their meaning, and even
Krapp's own auditory mirror image betrays him when Krapp is forced to look up
the word "viduity" in the dictionary (a word that made sense to him thirty
years ago). *Krapp's Last Tape*, as it is conventionally interpreted, is a
cautionary tale about "the last"---time, memory, desire, and nostalgia
[@doherty_krapps_1982, 191-204]. But we forget that it is also a commentary
about the "tape." Reel-to-reel recorders too will need further and
progressively more expansive annotations, as the technology fades from
collective memory. Thus, with the curtain drawn, we the audience, the readers,
and the custodians of this work are almost immediately implicated in Krapp's
narcissistic archival habits. We reach for the volume, read, reread, annotate,
and reshelve. *Krapp's Last Tape* is also a spool in our own collection---a spot
on the bookshelf that will continue to comfort and to unsettle us well into our
own dotage.

Staged at the dawn of personal audio recording, Beckett's play shifts the focus
of the conversation about archives from the public to the private sphere.
Jacques Derrida's "Archive Fever," given as a lecture in 1994 during a
conference entitled "Memory: The Question of Archives" and later published in
*Diacritics*, remains perhaps the paradigmatic text in the tradition that takes
the archive to be a predominately public space, subject to the power dynamics
between institutional patrons and custodians. For Derrida, the archive "has the
force of law, of a law which is the law of the house (*oikos*), of the house as
place, domicile, family, lineage, or institution" [@derrida_archive_1995 , 12].
Such a place preserves but also shelters the documents within. The archive
remembers and forgets, as Kenneth E. Foote reminds us in the *American
Archivist* [@foote_remember_1990]. Derrida goes further to recover the implicit
etymological roots of the word itself. "Archive" relates to *arkheion*:
"initially a house, a domicile, and address," but also *archons*, or "those who
commanded" [@derrida_archive_1995, 9]. In Derrida's understanding, the archive
is thus both a location and a power structure. And ultimately, it is an
institution, like the Freud Museum, where his paper was first presented.

Consider by contrast Krapp's dingy collection. It is hardly an institution---it
receives neither grants nor visitors, and Krapp himself is hardly a proper
*archon*: he throws the tapes down in anger, and unlike Freud, he leaves no
heirs to continue his lineage. In contrast to the Freud Museum, his collection
mostly consists of documents that have only a deeply personal significance. His
archive has less to do with social power structures and more with the
mechanisms of private identity formation, remembrance, and nostalgia. To mimic
Derrida here, we could say that his collection is a recollection---it is not a
house, but a yearning for a house: "nostalgia," from the Greek *nostos*, a
homecoming [@_nostalgia_2015].

### 4.2 Home (Media Being)

Reading the play through the lens of material conditions of media production
gives us more than just notes on stage design. *Krapp's Last Tape* captures the
mid-century movement between institutional and personal archiving practices.
It reveals the play as a commentary on a particular mode of being and a sense
of self that spans externalized representations of archived consciousness:
ledgers, spools, and boxes. Where the institution constitutes a site for
collective memory, the private archive gives space for the preservation of
self. We take notes, keep diaries, write to-do lists, and take photographs of
ourselves to remember the way we were and to provide a sense of continuity. It
is here, in the personal archive, one encounters the fragility of mind's
recall. Sounds, images, smells, and memories fade where the artifact endures.
The personal archive can thus be seen as an attempt to shore up natural human
defences against the forces of amnesia, time, decay, and oblivion.

The synchronic self occupies the present moment on a thin crest of biological
cognitive storage capability. The conscious self continually recedes into the
distance, threatening to dissolve into the ocean of non-being. The making of
lists, new years resolutions, the writing of diaries, self portraiture, and
audio dictation---all these activities orient the subject towards the mirage of
potential future conciousness. We are here confronted with a curious literature
that takes the past self as its subject, the future self as object, and the
present self as a guardian and archivist of that oath between past and future.
Through Beckett we perceive what Sartre called an appointment with one's own
sadness. "What will remain of my [interrupted] sadness," Sartre writes, "except
that I obligingly promise it an appointment for later after the departure of
the visitor" [@sartre_being_1993, 104]? *Krapp's Last Tape* reminds us that
such appointments cannot be limited to a mental construct, but instead
constitute a form of media being by which conciousness is secreted unto storage
media, archived, organized, and accessed at a later date. Such archives harden
biological being against memory loss and the loss of self.

By "media being" I would like to articulate here a set of related propositions
that, in complement to mechanisms of collective memory formation, identify
pervasive but still not well-studied practices of personal self-preservation.
The first of these distinguishes a range of structures that serve to
externalize and to preserve private mental states. The second sees such
structures as forms of extended cognition, where cognition should be taken not
in its metaphorical sense, but as palpable, real-world activity, susceptible
to the contingencies of geography, history, technology, and politics. The
third, takes such material extensions of self to constitute a specialized form
of literature, which, by contrast to other forms of communication, takes the
self both as subject and object (sender and recipient, author and reader,
playwright and audience) of transmission. Finally, and this is a matter of 

an archival practice aimed at the preservation of
externalized representations of conscounsness. The second understand such
archival practice as a mode of being, that in some sense extends.

"Perhaps the current rush to
'archive' has less to do with place/thing/practice and more with trying to save
and preserve a sense of self as we face the uncertain future, emphasizing our
agency in the selection and meaning making process that we fear threatens to
outpace us" @taylor_save_2012.

"It is that the word or sign man uses is the man himself" Pierce as quoted
@weel_changing_2012

These are perhaps heady thoughts, to be met with a measure of skepticism
towards the limits of literary interpretation. After all, what can a play tell
us about conciousness or memory. Yet, I am prepared to carry on this
conversation on more empirical basis.

Othe domestic space has always been, in some sense, an archival
domain. The book shelf, the pantry, the wall, and the mantle: these are the
locations where the family imposes private order, organizes its material life,
and into which it secretes its memories, preserving and curating artifacts from
its own pest. In a chapter on immigrant domestic interiors, for example,
Svetlana Boym writes about these typically Soviet curio cabinets, which present
"once a fragmentary biography of the inhabitant and a display of collective
memory" [@boym_future_2002, 334]. "If there had been such a thing as Soviet
cultural unconscious," she writes in *Common Spaces*, it would have been
structured like a communal apartment" [@boym_common_1995, 1610]. Similarly, in
"Life at Home in the Twenty-First Century," a ground-breaking "ethnoarcheology"
of contemporary American domestic space, a team of anthropologists (and a
photographer) document, describe, and interpret the "domestic material worlds"
of 32 Los Angeles families

### 4.3 Knowledge at Hand (Extended cognition)

What does it mean "have read" a book? Surely, when someone says "I too have
read this book" they mean something more than the mechanical action of turning
pages and moving one's eyes from left to right in a sequential manner.
Possessing or owning the book is also somewhat besides the point. A deeper
structure is implied. To have read is to claim to internalize, to understand,
and to form a mental image or opinion. But what exactly is internalized? It
cannot be the whole text, verbatim. By reading we mean something other than
rote memorization. In his *Blue and Brown Books*, written somewhere between the
*Tractatus* and *Philosophical Investigations*, Ludwig Wittgenstein gives the
example of a child who is asked to read, but who instead regurgitates the text
from memory. Wittgenstein further asks his readers to imagine an experimental
"human reading machine," which like the child "reads" by making sounds which
sometimes do and sometimes do not correspond with the printed word. An observer
not familiar with the mechanism of this experimental "reader," could be fooled
into thinking the machine is reading. The coincidence between sound and word
remains accidental, however. We would remain skeptical of this activity as
reading even if our machine were to begin to correlate letters to appropriate
sounds consistently [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120-1].

In his characteristically cryptic manner, Wittgenstein explains his thought
experiment by making yet another analogy:

> If A tries to make B believe that he is able to read Cyrillic script,
> cheating him by learning a Russian sentence by heart and then saying it while
> looking at the printed sentence, we may certainly say that A knows he is
> pretending, and that his not reading is characterized by a particular
> personal experience [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120-1].

But suppose the man really does know how to read Russian, although when he
reads he has a peculiar feeling of knowing the words by heart. Should we regard
his personal experience as the criterion distinguishing between reading and not
reading in that case? And again, Wittgenstein expects us to answer in the
negative. It seems then, that the functional performance of reading cannot not
determine the behavior alone. In each case, we had to check for the appropriate
internalized mental state. Wittgenstein writes, "We here envision two
mechanisms, the internal workings of which we can see, and this internal
working is the real criterion for a person's reading or not reading. But in
fact no such mechanisms are known to us in these cases"
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 120]. As it turns out, the mental state alone is also
insufficient to describe reading definitively. Here, Wittgenstein asks us to
imagine a person under the influence of drugs who is shown a set of discrete
strings composed of nonsensical characters. When shown some random string of
nonesensical characthers like `$%^&*`, for example, the drugged patient
imagines he is reading some English word, like "above" or "stair," as if the
typographical characters were meaningful. As far as the patient is concerned,
he is reading. All the structural attributes of the action are there---the
proper region of his brain is receiving stimulation; he follows the text with
his eyes from left to right; and silently mouths the words. But this too is
unacceptible: the patient merely imagines that he is reading
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 122].

In this way, neither the internal nor the external descriptions of the action
seem adequate to encompass everything we mean by reading. And yet we do have a
relatively clear picture of what reading properly entails, what it looks like,
what it sounds like, how to do it, and how to teach others to do it. In
building this chain of deferring analogies (from the reading child to the drug
induced reading hallucination) we are acting as though "we had tried to find
the real artichoke by stripping it of its leaves," writes Wittgenstein
[@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 125]. Instead, the leaves, when bundled together, are
the artichoke.

For Wittgenstein, our mistake lies in attempting to reduce cognitive activity
like "reading" to a set of either external (functional) attributes or internal
(formal) mental structures. Yet neither of these are sufficient. Reading
happens in the head and on the page [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 16]. Wittgenstein
explains that:

> In the consideration of our problems one of the most dangerous ideas is the
> idea that we think with, or in, our heads [...] "Thinking takes place in the
> head" really means only "the head is connected with thinking."---Of course
> one says also 'I think with my pen' and this localization is at least as good
> [@wittgenstein_blue_1965, 116].

In refusing to resolve the tension between functional (behaviorist) and formal
(structuralist) accounts of cognition, Wittgenstein's thought experiments
suggest a model of textual activity that sees reading and writing as a movement
and a correspondence between innate mental structures their external,
media-bound representation.

> Modern man finally drags a huge crowd of indigestible rocks of knowledge around
with him, which then occasionally audibly bang around in his body, as it says
in fairy tales. Through this noise the most characteristic property of this
modern man reveals itself: the remarkable contrast between an inside to which
nothing on the outside corresponds and an outside to which nothing inside
corresponds, a opposition of which ancient peoples were ignorant. Knowledge,
taken up to excess without hunger, even in opposition to any need, now works no
longer as a motive which reshapes and has a drive toward the outside. It stays
hidden in a certain chaotic inner world, which that modern man describes with a
strange pride as an “Inwardness” peculiar to him. Thus, people say that we have
the content and that only the form is lacking.

The belief that the organic is the chief criterion of what is authentic in art
and life continues, it need hardly be said, to have great force with us, the
more as we become alarmed by the deterioration of the organic environment. The
sense of something intervening between man and his own organic endowment is a
powerful element in the modern consciousness, an overt and exigent issue in our
culture.1 That technologies of the written word are somehow corrupting our
native cognitive capabilities, that we are becoming dependent on externalized
cognitive aids, and that such dependence has wide-ranging social repercussions,
are worries that have permeated the popular culture since the days of Socrates.
"I see within us all (myself included) the replacement of complex inner density
with a new kind of self," Richard Foreman writes in an essay that accompanied
his play The Pancake People. This new self is shallow, containing "less and
less of an inner repertory of dense cultural inheritance."2 Nicholas Carr
echoes these words in his recent article for the Atlantic Monthly, writing:
"Over the past few years I’ve had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or
something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural circuitry,
reprogramming the memory." "The deep reading that used to come naturally has
become a struggle," Carr concludes in an article which asks whether Google is
making us stupid.3 And yet, many also instinctively believe that technology is
working in exactly the opposite direction: that it expands, rather than
contracts human possibilities. In a recent bestseller promoted by the likes of
Bill Gates and Nicholas Negroponte, the authors and Microsoft researchers
Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell write about the era of total recall—a time when the
advances in computer technology will "change the way we work and learn [...]
unleash our creativity and improve our health," and ultimately "change what it
means to be human."4 "The era of total recall is dawning," write Bell and
Gemmell:

You may embrace full-scale “life logging,” and devote much effort to maximizing
your e-memories, or you may prefer to record your activities only modestly and
selectively, or even reject the whole idea and strive to leave as small a
digital life-footprint as possible [...] Whether you are an early adopter, a
late adopter, or a never-in-a-million-years nonadopter, society at large is on
an inexorable path toward Total Recall technology and it is going to transform
the world around you. The power of this transformation will be awesome.5

Regardless of your position in this on-going debate between the skeptics and
the cheerleaders of new technology, it is important to note that both camps
make some implicit assumptions about the role of technology in human
development. Both arguments contain an implicit model of the mind, by which
certain extra-corporeal prosthetic tools are seen to extend or diminish the
mind's natural intellectual capabilities. The purpose of this chapter is to
explore this thesis in a more formal way, first by summarizing the hypothesis
of extended cognition, advanced recently by several prominent philosophers of
mind, and second to contextualize that hypothesis historically, in order to
test the philosophical intuitions implicit in the conversation against
real-world experience.

The Hypothesis of Extended Cognition (HEC) The hypothesis of extended cognition
(HEC) holds that certain cognitive processes can be viewed as extending beyond
the boundaries of the human body into their physical, social, and symbolic
environments. Andy Clark and David Chalmers suggest an example involving Otto
and Inga: two individuals on their way to an art exhibition. Inga remembers the
location of the museum by memory. Otto suffers from Alzheimer's, and must
consult his notebook to find the exhibition. Clark and Chalmers posit that the
information in Otto's notebook is the same as the information in Inga's head.
And were the notebook literally inside Otto's brain somehow, we would have no
trouble equating the two cognitive acts of remembrance: Inga simply remembers
how to get to the exhibition, while Otto incorporates some cognitive aids to
facilitate his memory.6

For the externalists—Clark, Chalmers, Wilson, and others—the differences
between Otto's and Inga's case are superficial: both are engaged in essentially
identical cognitive tasks of recollection. On this view Otto's usage of a
notebook constitutes something like a unified cognitive system, which
encompasses parts of Otto's brain and parts of the physical pen-and-paper
apparatus. The pen and the notebook simply constitute the material or
technological elements of the system, enabling the storage and the retrieval of
information. Similarly, the notation itself—the alphabet by which Otto is able
to encode the needed information—can be seen as a symbolic and social component
of the system. Not just Otto's notes, but all language, according to the
externalists, serves as a kind of ready-made mental scaffolding, which enables
a level of computation and analysis otherwise unavailable to primates.7 The
study of cognition therefore must expand beyond the skin-and-bone boundary of
the human brain to include the social, symbolic, and material (technological)
artifacts involved in human thought. To study Otto's brain is to also to study
the pen, the notebook, and the notes Otto takes when he uses these things to
remember the details of his appointment.  In another paradigmatic example of
HEC-based analysis, Edwin Hutchins examines the workings of a commercial
airliner in flight, showing "how the cockpit system performs the cognitive task
of computing and remembering a set of correspondences between airspeed and wind
configuration."8 The system-level view of cognition draws attention to the
combination of mechanical, electronic, and biological processes responsible for
the flow and storage of information within the plane's cockpit. The system can
be said to "remember" its speeds, writes Hutchins. It "computes," "controls,"
"makes use of representations" and otherwise distributes cognitive labor. Were
we to ask, "Who is landing the plane?" we would expect Hutchins to answer "the
cockpit system as a whole."9

Two types of extension The opponents of HEC reject the view of cognition as
anything other than what goes on inside the body and the brain. Fred Adams and
Ken Aizawa in particular have staked out a clearly delineated position in
defense of what the authors call "contingent intracranialism." On this view,
the "mark of the cognitive" is located squarely within the brain, as a matter
of a contingent empirical fact.10 To prove their point, Adams and Aizawa
compare our intuitions about human tool use and animal digestion. Imagine
someone using loping shears to trim a bush, for example. Although the activity
of "trimming-a-bush" as a whole seems to be a combined product of human
muscular contraction and the mechanical capabilities of the loping shears, we
would not be compelled to think of loping shears as "extended muscular
contraction."

By contrast, something like arachnoid digestion constitutes a digestive process
that is truly external. Arachnoid digestion happens outside of the spider's
body literally: the spider regurgitates digestive enzymes into or unto its
prey. What happens in our stomachs happens outside the strict corporeal
boundaries of the spider. We could therefore meaningfully talk about "extended
digestion" when it comes to spiders. But, for Adams and Aizawa, Otto's
notebook-reliant memory looks less like arachnoid digestion and more like the
discrete movement of muscle against the mechanism of the garden shears. Otto is
not thinking literally outside of his head. Like the man with the garden
shears, he is using a tool to compliment the exercise of some internal,
biological function. But it seems to me that this line of reasoning is simply
begging the question. Adams and Aizawa merely appeal to a scientific standard
of internalsim, where the scientific standard is precisely the thing that is
being called into question. One gets the sneaking suspicion that the argument
is really about definitions, with one side appealing to common sense and the
other to scientific standards.11 My own suspicions about HEC rise from the
observation that the existentialist argument seems to contain two distinct
propositions about the nature of cognitive extension, each carrying distinct
implications for practical analysis of complex cognitive tasks. Let's return to
the example suggested by Hutchins in "How a Cockpit Remembers its Speed". We
begin by noting that a plane is a curiously anthropomorphic structure. It has
something like a head, a tail, and a belly: cockpit windows where we would
expect eyes, and a hole where we would expect to see an anus. It is thus easy
to imagine this structure as sentient somehow. We may for example, say "it
thinks, it sees," or "it eats" without much stretching of the imagination.

Suppose then, instead of discussing a complex, high-level biological process
such as cognition, we were to talk about digestion. The hypothesis of extended
digestion would then hold that digestion is not limited by the human body, and
that it may be seen as a systematic property of the plane as a whole. On this
view, the plane—its service staff and food storage mechanisms—all participate
in digestion, defined by the uptake of food, its distribution, and the disposal
of waste. We may even go as far as to say that digestion is something that
happens in the belly of the plane. Food is conveyed within by some mechanical
means, it is then divvied up among the passengers, processed, and expelled in
bulk with the emptying of the airplane's holding tanks.

How far are we willing to take the proposition of airplane digestion? Not very
far at all, I would argue. Clearly, this is not digestion as we know it. It has
some structural affinities to animal digestion (the food is conveyed within,
broken down, expelled) along with important structural differences (the food it
is not metabolized, for example). Thus a strong claim to airplane digestion
must be rejected as an imprecise metaphor, by which the concept of a given
process is transferred from one entity to another by structural similarity (the
same would hold true were we to consider fueling as a type of digestion).

Such metaphoric transference may prove to be conceptually useful in certain
types of analysis, as when the airlines want to improve the timely feeding of
their passengers, for example. "The plane needs to eat," they might say. "Our
staff has to feed the plane in a timely fashion." But, the metaphor strains
under scrutiny. We may as well stick to a more exacting description of the
process. In any case, what we have done here is extend the natural concept of
"digestion" (in its ordinary meaning) to an inanimate entity, or a system of
entities that includes biological and non-biological components. Furthermore,
we have discovered that such a functional analogy is subject to confusion by
metaphor.

Extrapolating from these observations, we should be able to draw the same
conclusions about cognition. The cockpit may look as if it is "'remembering its
speed," but its "memory"' is a mere metaphor. The two processes— human
remembrance and whatever happens in the cockpit—never reach full equivalence.
The metaphor does not inspire our full commitment. It is an alluring metaphor
however, particularly because the cockpit's shape and location (in relation to
the body of the plane) remind us of the human head. It might be a useful
metaphor for analyzing the information flow within the cockpit, but it is
imprecise when it comes to understanding human cognition as such. All that is
meant by human cognition does not map precisely unto the cognition as applied
to the airplane cockpit. Clearly some parts of the original definition are
simply left out—the firing of neurons and the transmission of glutamate, GABA,
or dopamine. Some aspect of the cockpit's operation may be likened to those
biological processes, but nobody would hold that they are fully equivalent.

There is a possibility of another, weaker claim to extended digestion, to
continue our example. The conveyance of food from the grocery shelves to the
mouth of an individual airplane passenger may well be an important part of that
passenger's digestive process. We are no longer talking about digestion in a
metaphoric sense, as we did when thinking about the belly of the plane. I mean
now literal digestion, as in "the breaking down of food." In that sense, there
is no reason for us to view our own digestion as much different from a
spider's. The preparation of food external to the human body could be viewed
much in the same way as we view arachnoid digestion. Both are external
processes evolved to aid in the break-down of tissues otherwise difficult to
digest internally. The spider regurgitates enzymes, where we use a knife, a
fork, a cheese grater, or any other kitchen implement for that matter.
Following similar logic, we may view the catering company responsible for
preparing the airline food as part of that extended digestion system. The
cooks, the forks, and the stewards all literally facilitate the break-down and
the conveyance of food into the passenger's belly. More than a thought
experiment, the understanding of digestion in this extended sense could be
quite useful in certain types of analysis, as in identifying the cause of
foodborne illness, for example. In the previous case we were making a
biomorphic analogy between two distinct processes: the digestion of food and
the fuelling or the supply of the plane. But now, we are actually trying to
expand the original concept of digestion, usually thought to be an internal
process, to include all sort of external mechanisms. We are no longer making an
imprecise analogy. Our position is one of true digestive externalism.  But in
expanding the definition of digestion outwards, we run into what I would like
to call "the problem of arbitrary limits." Let us return to cognition for the
moment. In thinking about the cognitive tasks involved in landing a plane, we
began by including the cockpit instrumentation and the communication between
the pilots into the equation. But why limit ourselves to the plane in our
analysis? The runway participates in the landing, and so do the dispatchers in
the control tower. We may then say the airport system as a whole is landing the
plane. That too seems to be an arbitrary boundary. The dispatchers rely on a
global network which memorizes, computes, and predicts landing parameters. At
the limits of this query is unbridled monism. The activity of "landing a plane"
begins to lose its meaning when the activity of the pilot is coupled with the
entire universe.

I conclude then, to say that extending the concept of cognition to the cockpit
of the plane is subject to the limit problem. The disavowal of the body and/or
brain as the natural boundary of cognition leads to an arbitrary placement of
yet another boundary. We have simply substituted the natural physical limits of
the brain with those of the airplane cockpit. And nothing holds us back from
pushing the boundaries of cognition ever outward. Every boundary seems
artificial, and every system seems to be a part of a larger system that could
be seen as participating in the cognitive task at hand. In embracing the
extension hypothesis literally, we have traded metaphoric imprecision for the
problem of arbitrary limits.

treat the tools of cognitive augmentation as seriously as we would our own

What is a well-formed thought? Is being able to communicate one's reasoning
clearly an integral part of clear reasoning? Can one think well, but write
poorly? Or does thinking well in a sense also mean writing well? I don't mean
to ask these questions to start an argument about cognition or rhetoric.
Rather, I would appeal to the intuitive sense of connection between the written
and the mental worlds and to simply note the natural correspondence between the
two. There is a bit of magic in that correspondence—the kind of magic that
becomes transparent (and disappears from view) through acclimation. Here is a
simple to-do list from my partner. For some moments after reading it, her will
has become my command. My arms and legs move under the spell of her bidding.
For her part, she has ensured that the list reflects what she wants me to do.
That is, it reflects what she wants. And in her absence, the to-do list did
represent her volition accurately. I read it as a testament to her will; I was
able to internalize the instructions; and then I acted on their behalf. We may
say that the to-do list was used to synchronize an aspect of our mental lives.
It was an interface of sorts, which has allowed us to bridge two separate
mental worlds, mediated by a piece of paper. And yet how quickly we discard it!
The interface itself is perhaps too thin and transparent to hold our (critical)
attention.

An interface is literally a point of contact. The elevator button, for example,
is a quintessential interface between you and the mechanism of the elevator.
The button allows the will of the operator to become one with the action of the
machine. It is an interface designed to accept human input. But, from the
elevator's point of view, the human finger is the interface to the human. In
the combined operation of human and elevator it is thus difficult to pinpoint
the exact physical boundaries of the contact. The interface is paper-thin, we
may say—it happens when a thing slides into the other, and for a moment both
become one: a shared physiology and a shared intentional apparatus. We could
say that our to-do list is a point of contact between two people. But before
being that, it was a point of contact between a person, a piece of paper, and
writing. For the purposes of this dissertation, a literary interface is a
specialized point of contact between the mental, the symbolic, and the
technological modes of being.

Let's examine the piece of paper more closely. A literary interface is first
and foremost mediated by language. But language alone is not enough to
constitute even a simple to-do list. We must also have writing—a way to record
language for later recall or further dissemination. The to-do list also
requires a pen and a piece of paper or any transferrable storage medium. I
therefore insist on "literary" and not merely "textual" or "linguistic"
interfaces, because my concern here is not with any individual text or
utterance, but already with a system of such recorded texts or utterances—a
physical, artifactual system, which encompasses a range of possible activities.
These may include the ability to read and to write, but also to select,
highlight, underline, format, annotate, review, redact, skim, commit to memory,
store, archive, retrieve, search, borrow, lend, tag, comment, ruffle through
the pages, digest, process (as in word processing), type, scribble, click,
zoom, drag, drop, cut, and paste. It is this system as a whole that I propose
to designate as "literary" (and this in contrary to some more specialized
definitions of the same).

A literary interface is secondly an artifact of mental (cognitive) activity. To
my mind, a text, like the to-do list for example, is always a privileged
symbolic representation. I say this because I think it, and because what I
write can be said to represent the state of my mind. Or at least I want it to
represent accurately the state of my mind. Even if I wanted to deceive you as
to the state of my mind, the deception would at least represent my desire to
deceive (we will deal with truly un-intentional texts also in the scope of the
dissertation). A text is a snapshot of sorts, which captures a fleeting moment
from the stream of private, internal, and generally invisible mental events in
the shape of a symbolic (representational), but nevertheless tangible,
material, externalized and therefore visible artifacts. By contrast, spoken
language is never fully externalized. At the exact moment of utterance my
speech is still a part of my body. It is inside of me literally: on its way
out, but still inside, near the tongue and the palate, still contained within
my larynx. But in typing these words (rather than merely speaking them) I
intend to spend much effort to enforce the congruity between what I think and
what you read, asynchronously, through the intermediacy of language, text, and
word-processing software (in my case). That intermediacy between the mental and
the written is a part of the interface, in a way that the "interface between
science and the humanities" may signify a common boundary between two distinct
disciplines. The literary interface is privileged not just because it encodes
an aspect of one's mental world, but because in the moment of contact, it is an
aspect of that mental world. And for that moment, it is as dear to me as a toe
or a finger, or perhaps as a dream or a recollection.

And finally, a literary interface is a material artifact. By this I mean that
something like a pen, paper, a computer screen, or a keyboard is involved in
the practice of using literary interfaces. Just like an elevator button,
literary interfaces are physical objects. They come into being through usage,
and make no sense as discrete objects, as in the case of the elevator control
panel removed from the passenger and the mechanism of the elevator. Or rather,
I should say that elevator buttons make no sense removed from the action of
pressing buttons and transporting things and people between floors. An
interface is a kind of a verbalized noun—its understanding must come not just
in the examining the artifact, but in examining the artifact in action. Only in
action can we observe the momentary unity between the literary, the cognitive,
and the artifactual.

Southall. Interfaces between the designer and the document

It may seem at first a bit odd to put the words "style" and "cognition" in the
same sentence, but the concept of "cognitive style" is well-articulated in the
scientific literature on the psychology of personality. The idea of cognitive
stylistics was developed first by the American followers of Carl Jung, who like
Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers (of the still
ubiquitous Myers-Briggs Type Indicator offered by career placement centers
across the country) were interested in applying insights from
quantitatively-based psychological observation (psychometrics) to problems of
labor and education. In the early 1950s, the idea of "personality type" gave
way to "cognitive style" in the work of psychologists George Klein, Philip
Holzman, Riley Gardner, and Herbert Schlesinger.1 For this new generation of
scholars, the concept meant something like "the individual differences in
adaptive modes of organizing and experiencing the stimulus world."2 That is to
say that people simply have or develop a preference for a particular mode of
thinking about and perceiving the world. Or even simpler: "everyone does it in
his own way."3 Thus, in an early experiment Gardner observes a group of people
categorizing objects by size, shape, and color. Predictably, different people
perceive the differences between size, shape, and color in differing
gradations.4 The converse of this experiment suggests also that certain modes
of material organization favor a particular style of thought. We may assume,
for example, that certain ways of organizing the world attract or "make sense"
to a particular type of person. In the literature on education, the concept is
therefore popular within the discussion of learning styles, by which teachers
are encouraged to present their material in ways accessible to students with
varying preferences for visual, auditory, tactile, or kinesthetic learning.

The hypothesis of cognitive styles underlies a particular belief about the
connection between mental organization and the organization of objects in the
real world. It is what Heidegger called "the correlation between being, word,
gathering, hand, and writing"5 and perhaps what Nietzsche meant when he wrote
that "our writing tools are also working on our thoughts."6 Heidegger in
particular is often cited in this regard. In his meditation on Parmenides,
delivered as a series of lectures during the war at the University of Freiburg,
Heidegger is clearly bothered by what he perceives as the "irruption of the
typewriter into the realm of the world of handwriting."7 Ever in search of
essences, he imagines hand-writing to possess a special kind of magic, denoting
"an original essential nexus, to which the indicating writing-hand belongs." He
continues to say that: [...] in handwriting the relation of Being to man,
namely the word, is inscribed in beings themselves. The origin and the way of
dealing with writing is already in itself a decision about the relation of
Being and of the word to man and consequently a decision about the comportment
of man to beings and about the way both, man and thing, stand in
unconcealedness or are withdrawn from it.8

The typewriter somehow disturbs this idyllic picture, withdrawing "from man the
essential rank of the hand, without man's experiencing this withdrawal
appropriately and recognizing that it has transformed the relation of Being to
his essence."9 In my favorite bit of condescension from the old master,
Heidegger goes as far as to suggest that his readers misunderstand him
precisely because type-setting is so groundless. "The typewriter is a signless
cloud," he writes, "a withdrawing concealment in the midst of its very
obtrusiveness […] not showing itself to its essence." "Perhaps that is why most
of you, as is proven to me by your reaction, though well-intended, have not
grasped what I have been trying to say."10

What is Heidegger trying to say here? And what precisely is being concealed by
the typewriter? In "The Question Concerning Technology," originally published
in 1954, Heidegger explains that technology is primarily a mode of revealing
truth. To make this point, Heidegger begins with an analysis of a specific
artifact—a silver chalice used for ceremonial rights. Initially, it seems that
the primary purpose of the artifact is to facilitate something, the
administration of ceremonial rites in this case. The cup is an instrument for
something, in other words; it is a means to an end. Another way to put it would
be to say that the ceremony is the cause for the cup's very existence. But
there is more than just causa finalis, as Heidegger puts it. The physical
properties of silver (causa materialis) also constitute a cause, as does the
shape of the cup (causa formalis), and as does the silversmith who has
fashioned the vessel (the silversmith being causa efficiens). In fact the cup's
very instrumentality is grounded in this chain of causation. The cup is an
occasion to bring forth the ceremony; to bring forth a certain property of
silver; to bring forth the water-containing property of the vessel's shape; and
finally to bring forth the craft of the silversmith. The making of the cup is
not mere "handicraft manufacture," Heidegger writes, nor is it "only artistic
and poetical bringing into appearance and concrete imagery," but rather a
"bringing-forth, "poiesis in the highest sense."11

At its best, technology reveals truth. At this point of the essay Heidegger
makes a distinction between traditional technology or "handicraft," and modern,
machine-powered technology.12 Modern technology also reveals, writes Heidegger.
But it does not "unfold into a bringing-forth in the sense of poiesis." Rather
modern technology is a challenge or a provocation [Herausfordern] to nature.
The figure of the natural betrays the extent of Heidegger's romanticism. "The
revealing that is modern technology is a challenging, which puts to nature the
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as
such," writes Heidegger.13 "But does it hold true for the old windmill as
well?" he asks. And answers, No. Its sails do indeed turn in the wind; they are
left entirely to the wind's blowing. But the windmill does not unlock energy
from the air currents in order to store it. In contrast, a tract of land is
challenged in the hauling out of coal and ore. The earth now reveals itself as
a coal mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit. The field that the
peasant formerly cultivated and set in order appears different from how it did
when to set it in order still meant to take care of and to maintain. The work
of the peasant does not challenge the soil of the field. In sowing grain he
places seed in the keeping of the forces of growth and waits over its increase.
[By contrast] agriculture is now the mechanized food industry. Air is now set
upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield uranium, for
example; uranium set upon to yield atomic energy, which can be released either
for destruction or for peaceful use.14

The passage is remarkable for its apparent prescience of the contemporary
environmental conservation movement, which often implies a similar conservative
romanticism about handicraft technology. Both ideologies contain a particular
notion of "authentic" or "unadulterated" state of nature, which is
"challenged," to use Heidegger's terminology, by the tools of modern
technology. Handicraft, by contrast, is seen as an activity that operates in
harmony with nature, without undue disturbance. This view is of course
historically incorrect. Pre-modern hunting practices and agriculture have often
led to large-scale ecological disturbances: pollution, species extinction, and
deforestation. In this context, the distinction between modern and pre-modern
itself begins to seem arbitrary. The latent romantic naturalism strains under
further scrutiny. The silver chalice, for example, can be seen as the
culmination of a long and destructive process of mining, ore processing,
smelting, and manufacture, which at each stage involves the very opposite of
Heidegger's ideal non-disruptive poiesis.

A more chartable reading of the passage would attempt to place Heidegger's
critique of modern technology in the context of his phenomenology. Heidegger's
phenomenology is a weighty, but well-explored topic, and for this reason I will
limit our discussion to its most generally-known and relevant features. For
Heidegger, our knowledge of the world comes in two flavors: presentness-at-hand
[Vorhandenheit] and readiness-to-hand [Zuhandenheit]. When we think of some
object in the world—a hammer, to use the famous example—we first imagine
something like the formal definition of a hammer in a series of knowable facts
about the object: a hammer is made of metal and wood, we use it to pound nails,
it is man's first tool, and so on. The type of epistemological knowledge about
the world, the knowledge that combines the readily observable properties and
our shared understanding of the object, is called "present-to-hand" in
Heidegger's system. "Ready-to-hand" knowledge by contrast is practical. I know
something about the hammer, but I also have used a hammer—and in using it I
understood the tool in an applied manner. But more than that, in using the
hammer I understand something about the nail. An essential property of the
transition between theoretical and applied knowledge of the world, is the
disappearance of the tool. For Heidegger, the tool literally becomes a kind of
"sight," helping us identify properties of the world that are particularly
well-suited for its application. "Action has its own kind of sight," Heidegger
writes in Being and Time.15 The hammer helps us experience the nail in a
hammering kind-of-a-way. Hammering reveals something about the nail, and by
extension, about metals in general. At the bottom of this experience is man's
relationship to nature itself. All "good" technologies work in that way for
Heidegger. "Technology comes to presence in the realm where revealing an
unconcealment take place, where aletheia, truth, happens," he writes in "The
Question Concerning Technology."16 The plow reveals something about the earth,
just as the windmill reveals something about the air current.

Modern technology reveals too, but it breaks the "natural" phenomenological
experience in two important ways. First, the tool fails to fully disappear into
the experience. I imagine this to be the same kind of a feeling a musician has
when playing an unfamiliar instrument. The instrument "stands in the way" of
the unity between man and music. Second, the modern instrument introduces a
kind of a perceptual bias. It treats nature as a reserve of energy [Bestand]—as
a kind of a storehouse, an inventory, or a collection. Whereas the farmer's
plow reveals the earth as fertile ground, the tractor reveals it to be a mere
resource for mechanized agriculture. The earth ceases to be an object of
knowledge, amenable to other ways of knowing. In this way, modern technology
works to "order" or to "enframe" matter, interfering with the very process of
truth-formation. Moreover, just as the earth ceases to be the object of
knowledge, the ordering—or to use the very un-Heideggerian term, the
commodification—of natural resources threatens to turn the human into a
resource. For Heidegger, modern technology disrupts the status of the human as
a proper subject:

Only to the extent that man for his part is already challenged to exploit the
energies of nature can this revealing which orders happen. If man is
challenged, ordered, to do this, then does not man himself belong even more
originally than nature within the standing–reserve? The current talk about
human resources, about the supply of patients for a clinic, gives evidence of
this. The forester who measures the felled timber in the woods and who to all
appearances walks the forest path in the same way his grandfather did, is today
ordered by the industry that produces commercial woods, whether he knows it or
not. He is made subordinate to the orderability of cellulose, which for its
part challenged forth by the need of paper, which is then delivered to
newspapers and illustrated magazines.

The commodification of both subject and object commodifies phenomenology
itself. One can perceive more than a hint of Marx in this line of critique.  If
the plow reveals something about the earth, the pen reveals something about
language. The relationship between man and language is of a primary importance
to Heidegger. In the realm of language, man stands in relation to being itself.
Heidegger's own discourse often progresses through a series of etymological
reconstructions, which contain an almost mystical sense of reverence for the
veracity of meaning contained in the original, Greek understanding of a given
concept. By similar logic, the hand represents a "pure," unadulterated
relationship of man to language. The hand "contains an essence of the human
being because the word, as the essential region of the hand, is the essential
ground of being human."17 In the metaphoric juxtaposition between word and
ground, the analogy between pen and plow becomes apparent. And just like
mechanized agriculture, mechanized writing "deprives the hand of dignity in the
realm of the written word and degrades the word to a mere means for the traffic
of communication."18 The typewriter commodifies language in other words,
turning it into the "standing reserve" of information. "In mechanized writing
all humans begin to look the same," writes Heidegger.19 Intermedia as
Syncopation between Human, Machine, and Language It has been suggested that
Heidegger's distaste for mechanized writing stemmed from his inability to
type.20 Don Ihde, a contemporary authority on Heidegger's philosophy of
technology, suggests that all new mechanisms go through an awkward stage of
sorts, in which they still feel unfamiliar to us, and therefore disruptive in
the way an unfamiliar instrument is "in the way" of music for a musician. But
with time, these technologies once again become transparent to us, and the link
between man and language is once again restored in the fluent hands of a nimble
typist.21 Such an attempt to "de-romanticize"22 Heidegger's argument cannot
fully diffuse the rhetorical force of his critique. Heidegger's romanticism
continues to exert considerable influence on contemporary thought, particularly
when it comes to the discussion about emerging technology, and especially in
the fields of literary and cultural studies. Perhaps the most visible (in a
sense of well-known and often-cited) example of this trend is Friedrich
Kittler's 1986 Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. In the conclusion of this
book-length study, Kittler brings the Heideggerian rhetoric to its natural
paranoiac crescendo: "A simple feed-back loop—and information machines bypass
humans—their so-called inventors […] Electronics, a tube monster since
Bletchley Park, replaces discourse, and programmability replaces free will […]
Under the condition of high technology, literature has nothing more to say. It
ends in cryptograms that defy interpretation and only permit interception." As
evidence for this vision, Kittler submits a letter/poem which resembles a
nonsensically-encoded communiqué addressed to Truman, Roosevelt, Stalin, and
Churchill.23 A more tempered position, along the same Heideggerian lines, was
advanced by Erich Kahler, a prominent American literary critic writing in the
1960s, who saw the history of the avant-garde movements in the 20th century
following a downward trajectory of formal disintegration—from the initial
purging of sentiment in the nouveau roman, to the dissolution of language in
the final "typographical stage" of literary development.24 Kahler's ultimate
worry was over what he called "the triumph of incoherence," which leads to "the
dissolution of the linguistic form," "the divorce of language from its human
source," and finally, to the destruction of consciousness itself (when
consciousness for him is defined as coherent perception of the world25). "What
started as poetry," writes Kahler, "ends up in typography."26 "Under the
fanfares of thrilling innovations sounding everywhere, from Brazil to Iceland,
literature fades away, not only into graphics, but into motley sound
associations and mechanistic regimentation:" The overwhelming preponderance of
collectivity with its scientific, technological and economic machinery, the
daily flow of new discoveries and inventions that perpetually change aspects
and habits of thought and practice, the increasing incapacity of individual
consciousness to cope with the abstract anarchy of its environment, and its
surrender to a collective consciousness that operates anonymously and diffusely
in our social and intellectual institutions—all this has shifted the center of
gravity of our world from existential to functional, instrumental, and
mechanical ways of life. At the same time the hypertrophy of functional
rationalization has produced an overcompensating irrationality, reversing to
the bodily concrete or spiraling to the absurd. Hence the products of the
avant-gardes display a strange blend of erratic imaginative vagaries with
technological and pseudo-scientific aspirations. Fragments of unconscious and
sensory experience are in a ghostly manner treated with an exactitude derived
from the rational consciousness and information.27 

I take Kahler's reaction to concrete poetry as an eloquent, if somewhat
misguided, expansion of Heidegger's "typewriters are ruining things" thesis.
The argument is again a restatement of the connection between technology,
language, and consciousness—a triad that resurfaces every few decades as a
manifestation of our collective technophobic hypochondria.

In my understanding, the practice of concrete poetry stands in diametric
opposition to the thesis advanced by Heidegger, Kittler, and Kahler—a vision of
literary dissolution under the conditions of high technology. The artifice of
Emmett Williams's "Sometimes" (Figure 4.1) lies in the reinserting of the
writing implement into the protected world of the poetic. The poem is
impossible without the machine. Reading or reciting it is not enough: we are
meant to type, or at least to imagine typing the poem. Classical scansion is
not sufficient either. We must be able to imagine the rhythm of the typewriter:
the sharp hammer-like movement of its type-bars, the clicking of the platern,
the whizzing sound and the bell of the lever-operated carriage return. The
typewriter "thinks" in so far as it suggests a particular style—of writing,
thinking—a style that has an impetus, a logic, and a poetry of its own. The
rhythmic impetus of the typewriter pulls the poem along a particular metric
trajectory. The poet disrupts that logic with a correction. The resulting
grapheme, documents the interruption, and in the process pulls the material
world into the literary. The smudge of the ribbon, the rejected versions of the
poem, the mark of the proofreader, and yes the typewriter itself—all of these
"extra-literary" elements of the creative process are elevated to the status of
the poetic. Another way to describe the dynamic between literature and
technology in this case, would be to say that the concretist aesthetic
appropriates the extra-functional elements of the writing mechanism. What
initially seems a mere artifact of literary production becomes art. Literature
thus taints technology, stripping away the pretense of pure functionalism.
Under the condition of the literary, to reverse Kittler here, technology gains
a new voice. Nothing is determined about the encounter between human, machine,
and language. Each element of this triad contains a mere suggestion of rhythm
and pace. The resulting symphony is a syncopation of all three elements. There
is of course nothing particularly modern about his dynamic. The printing press
introduced a particular poetics into the language as well. It is just that
after a time, the cognitive style of the printing press has become transparent
to us, particularly after publishing had congealed into a relatively stable
system of production and distribution. The advent of the typewriter, of desktop
publishing, and of distributed, online models of publication destabilizes the
established stylistics. With each of these advancements we worry anew about the
impact of technology on our way of thinking—a concern that goes back to the
introduction of writing itself, as in Plato's Phaedrus.

The history of concrete poetry can be seen as the culmination of one such
shift, spurred on by the transference of type-setting from the printer to the
author. This dynamic may explain the simultaneous eruption of concrete poetry
across multiple literary traditions. "The confused geography of its beginnings
reflects the universality of its roots," Williams writes.28 He then suggests
the following signposts upon this landscape: the "constellation" poetry of
Eugene Gomerenger; the posters of Carlo Belloli and F.T. Marinetti; the
Noigandres poets of Sao Paulo; the work of the Danish poet Oyvin Fahlstrom; the
ideagrams of Dieter Roth; the sound-poetry experiments of the East German poet
Carlfriedrich Claus; the collaborative work of the Vienna composer Gerhard
Ruhm, architecht Friedrich Achleitner, a jazz musician Oswald Weiner, and the
poets H.C. Atmann and Konrad Bayer in the early fifties; and finally Williams's
own work with the Darmstadt Circle, which included the Kitasano Katue of Japan
and the German dramaturgist Claus Bremer.29 To this topography we could add an
increasingly long list of "intermedial" work by Vladimir Mayakovsky and
Guillame Apollinaire in the early 1920s, several of Lewis Carroll's poetic
experiments, and much work from non-western traditions, in alphabets that have
always contained a strong visual element (Chinese, Arabic, etc).  In this
light, concrete poetry can be seen as the culmination of a particular
techno-cognitive style—a full-blown artistic movement which peaks at the
eclipse of the typewriter age. The cognitive style of concrete poetry, if one
may speak of such a thing, is one of cross-modal perception. It literally
attempts to engage areas of the brain not normally affected by passive reading.
Artists associated with Fluxus and concrete poetry were committed to the
development of what they called intermedia. In his 1966 "Statement on
Intermedia," Dick Higgins, the Cambridge-born poet, composer, and publisher,
writes: For the last ten years or so, artists have changed their media to suit
this situation, to the point where the media have broken down in their
traditional forms, and have become merely puristic points of reference. The
idea has arisen, as if by spontaneous combustion throughout the entire world,
that these points are arbitrary and only useful as critical tools, in saying
that such-and-such a work is basically musical, but also poetry. This is the
intermedial [sic] approach, to emphasize the dialectic between the media. A
composer is a dead man unless he composes for all the media and for his
world.30 The spontaneous invention of this artistic program in Switzerland,
Italy, Argentina, Germany, and the United States31 is contemporaneous with the
turn to cross-modal perception studies in post-war psychology. At the core of
this shared program is a new understanding of cognitive stylistics. As Marshal
McLuhan, himself associated with the Fluxus movement, wrote in his 1967
Verbi-Voco-Visual Explorations, "the physics of typographic lineality have
dominated our perception."32 But, as Kahler notes in his anti-concretist
polemic, this approach has also erased the boundaries between the
socially-constructed categories that separate the literary from the visual and
auditory arts. With that expansion come the loss of specificity and the
dissolution of the protective barriers that usually separate genre and medium.
Fluxus could thus be viewed as a type of cognitive calisthenics, designed to
loosen the rigidity of fixed mental perception—a mental rigidity reinforced by
the rigidity in cultural categories (epistemology).
