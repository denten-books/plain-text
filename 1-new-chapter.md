# Chapter 1: Literature Down to the Pixel

## Where is the text?

Where is the text? If you are reading this book in print, you can point to the
page and be fairly certain of the answer. If you are reading the book on a
*device*, things get more complicated. You can point to the screen and yet it
would be wrong to say that the text is there. When you power down the device,
the screen will go dark, but the text won't disappear. It will still be stored
somewhere, in another physical location, embedded into some sort of storage
medium. It will take us the rest of the book to tease out where it goes. And
even if the text you are reading is on paper, you can imagine that it was not
always so. This text, like most literature today, was "born digital." At some
point, it occupied that duplicitous position between storage medium and pixel.

Text, medium, and pixel: these words already bring me discomfort. I know what
they mean and yet I do not. Few literate readers today will be able to give an
account of a pixel's passage from keystroke to ink or pixel. The vast machinery
of literature is hidden from the readers view. Of course, it was always like
that to some extent. Writing in general is meant to evoke a sense of ease where
it is more often the product of painstaking labor and revision. Let us hold on
to that intuition as well: writing hides labor. There is the labor of the
writer. There is also labor in the sense of raw energy. The work it takes to
get a rock up a mountain gives it energy potential to roll back down the hill.
We can convert that potential energy into useful labor. The rock can pull
something up the hill as it is falling down, for example. What of the energy
that went into the writing of these sentences? I spent a few *joules* of energy
compressing the springs under my keyboard. Many more went into my laptop as
electric current, in *amperes* that overcome the resistance of *ohms*. There is
the energy of mental labor too or "knowledge work." There is energy too in the
librarian's effort to archive this work, in the churning of a search engine to
make it accessible to a reading public, and in the work of a truck driver who
likely handled the physical object in your hand now. The sum of these energies,
which seem significant now in their accumulation, went into writing of these
words. Much of it dissipated as heat and light. And some of it---just a small
part---left an imprint somewhere. It left a trace of ink on a page, magnetized
a piece of tape, or shifted the configuration of the floating gate buried
within the solid state drive.

Finally, the *joules* that remain wrapped in the word, started a chain of
electrical reactions in the reader's brain. That is is the hidden magic of
writing. Reading physically leaves the brain in a different state than before.


## How will we find it?

## "microanalysis," 

the closest possible kind of reading
that pays attention to the material contexts of knowledge production.

## Microanalysis opens the gap between text as it is embedded into storage media
and text as it is seen on the screen. 


## Gerard Genette and Nelson Goodman on the nature of textual copies,

## "reading" from the perspective of a copy machine, 
which "sees" pages
as monolithic images. 

## the crisis of authenticity 

related to the plummeting costs of digital
reproduction. The supposedly "dead" authors continue to draw checks from
copyrighted work. 

## Legal fictions rise to veil the emerging affordances of
textual technology.
