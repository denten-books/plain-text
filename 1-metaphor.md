# Chapter 1: Metaphor Machines

In the 1990s, I understood Jean Baudrillard's writing on simulacra in
relationship to the media entertainment complex: amusement parks, virtual
reality, and reality television. Today his writing gains another layer of
meaning related directly to the ubiquity of personal computing. Computers, as
I will argue in this chapter, do more than compute. They are metaphor machines
that mediate experience universally. They interject in simple everyday acts
from drinking coffee in the morning, through automatic brewing machines and
payment systems, to going to bed as alarm clocks and night activity monitors.

Baudrillard writes about the "genesis of simulacra," which culminates
precisely in the totalizing mediation of code:

> At the limit of an always increasing elimination of references and
> finalities, an ever-increasing loss of resemblances and designations, we
> find the digital and programmatic sign, whose "value" is purely *tactical*,

My concern here is with the structure of code, the programmatic sign, which
splits its energies between the screen and hard drive. On the screen, at the
site of projection, the programmatic sign simulates familiar materialities:
buttons, bins, files, folders, drawers, desktops, windows, tiles, wood grain,
drop shadows, chrome. At the site of storage, from which the sign emanates,
the language changes to the vocabulary of control, referring to central
processing units, compilation, commitment, extraction, command, condition,
initiation, handling, function, persistence, and execution. In the rift
between the sites of storage---what is---and projection---what appears to
be---the programmatic sign undergoes a series of structural transformations.
What originates from (a) the keyboard as the mechanical action of a switch
becomes (b) an electric signal that (c) leaves a magnetic mark in computer
memory, which (d) further morphs into a phase of the liquid crystal on the
screen, leaving behind (e) the letter that emanates outward as light.
Programming languages, rules for transformation between media, bridge the
passage between bodies, screens, and archives, breaking thought up into
differentiated units for transfer. Simulation emerges in the reassembly of
such units back into a continuous integrated whole. Texts dissolve into
letters and pixels which then congeal back into holistic literary works.

Roman Jakobson called such construction and deconstruction of meaning the
"profuse exchange of ritualized formulas" or the phatic function of language
[@malinowski_problem_1923, 146; @jakobson_linguistics_1960, 355]. In the
phatic function lies the essence of programming. Code shapes and commands. At
the same time, it conjures fantastical metaphors to occlude the structure of
shaping and commanding. Simulation obscures the incongruence between visible
representation and the underlying material affordances of the medium. What you
see is not always what you get. We are instead confronted with a composite
image, which under examination reveals a complex process of transfiguration
between the visible sign and the sign at the site of the inscription. When
reading online, for example, we observe what looks like a book, where we
should also perceive an attempt to censor and surveil. The simulation is
without a referent. It bares little resemblance to the material substrata of
electronic reading. We believe we are handling a book. Our ideas about reading
and interpretation subsequently rely on that initial physical point of contact
with paper. But when reading electronically, we are handling something other
than print material. The semblance to paper guides our intuitions about the
possibilities of the medium: the ability to scroll, bookmark, or turn pages.
We have far fewer intuitions about the affordances of inscription at the
micromolecular level. As we "turn the page" on the screen an electric charge
embedded into a solid state medium crosses the impenetrable oxide barrier,
reaching its destination, the floating gate, through quantum tunnelling, which
exploits the wave-particle duality of matter and its corollary the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle [@pavan_flash_1997; @aaron_flash_2002;
@bez_introduction_2003]. In this way, the everyday inscription---a digital
word---comprises numerous improbable events at quantum scale.

What can be said then about the practices of reading and interpretation
grounded in such remote physicalities? For now, only that they continue to
unfold figuratively, removed from the material conditions of knowledge
production. Metaphor sustains our lives in digital worlds artificially, by
analogy with habituated media. We already know what to do with paper; the
electronic book therefore replicates paper. Such metaphors dull the discomfort
at the point of contact between human and machine. They hinder the effort of
mastering poetics at the quantum level: the ability to inject electrons, draw
lattices, manipulate arrays, affect solid states of being. It is tempting to
view media ecosystems that host our digital lives as a kind of a natural
element like water or air. But we should not forget also that computational
ecologies are constructed environments. They are not governed by the laws of
physics in the same sense that clouds or oceans are. They form a part of a
massive tactical effort to bring private spaces of inhabitance---think the
*Home* folder on your computer, your family photo album, your digital
bookmarks---under the purview of computational control. The simulation encodes
political structures that should not be naturalized, lest we succumb to the
complacency of technological determinism. Our goal in this chapter is to
arrest the advance of the metaphor. We must begin to separate resemblances
from their designations, the apparent shape from a command in the imperative.

What does it mean to turn a page in a medium that sustains neither turning nor
pages? In this chapter, we will use the tools of cognitive metaphor theory to
tell the story of metaphor's influence on computation, at a formative moment
in the history of human-computer interaction. I plan to approach this
tradition from within, taking on its language and assumptions in the first
several sections of the chapter. The latter sections capture the historical
transition between literal computing, by which users gave explicit commands to
their machines, and the so-called "direct manipulation" model, by which they
began to occupy virtual, figurative environments. The chapter draws on the
archives from graphic design, literary theory, and computer science---fields
that come into direct contact in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The trajectory
from the conversational to the "direct" model of human-computer interaction
points to the speculative possibility of seemingly unmediated coupling between
human and machine---a possibility that I acknowledge and finally reject
outright in the conclusion of the chapter.

## Verisimilitude

From the many available theories of metaphor, in this chapter I rely on the
ideas from the so called "cognitive metaphor" school developed extensively by
George Lakoff, Mark Johnson, and Mark Turner among others in the 1980s. This
school of thought gained influence in the formative period in the history of
human-computer interaction. It is therefore important for me to examine the
vocabulary of that tradition on its own terms and to advance its critique from
within. It bares mentioning at the outset that in the language of cognitive
metaphor theory all figurative tropes of comparison---hyperbole, metonymy,
synecdoche, or simile---fall under the category of metaphor. To avoid
confusions of the sort, to get onto the same page if you will, I plan to spend
a few pages now delving into the technical vocabulary of metaphor theory. This
language will later help us explore the ways by which metaphors make and
unmake everyday computational environments of human habitation. I am
interested here and throughout the book in a particular mode of virtual
habitation and habituation, which by its very nature begins and ends with the
technologies of metaphor.

In the 1980s, a number of influential publications in the field of
human-computer interaction relied on insights from cognitive metaphor theory
to refashion computers from business productivity tools into tools of the
imagination, as ultimate metaphor machines. In this light, computer interfaces
mediate the transference between human and machine, at the liminal space where
two disparate systems of representation meet to exchange information.
Interfaces can be said to translate machine states---the configuration of open
and closed circuits---into pictures, numbers, and letters, all species of
human cognitive states. The metaphor machine, a mechanism for universal
symbolic transference, is capable of simulating anything that can be
represented symbolically.[^ln1-database]

The language of computation reveals its reliance on structural metaphor in
practice. Consider the following passage from a patent filed by Xerox in 1991.
It describes, in its own words, "an electronic library metaphor," which
includes:

> a shared books with data base metaphor, a reference books metaphor, and
> a card catalog metaphor in one system that allows large object oriented data
> bases to be organized and accessed in an exclusive environment and in
> addition allows access to screen icons, creates a visual hierarchy of
> related and shared objects, and allows mutually exclusive access to the
> metaphors within the library [@pajak_electronic_1992, 1].

The invention ultimately enables the "organizing, accessing, and querying of
information unique to physical libraries in an electronic workstation
environment" [@pajak_electronic_1992, 1]. Setting aside, for a moment, the
peculiarity of being able to patent a metaphor, note the idiosyncrasy of the
technical language. What does it mean to "access" a metaphor, for example?
Were someone to "check out" a book from the electronic library, would they
hold a book or its metaphor alone? What mechanisms would assure the integrity
between a database and its metaphor? Is the visual hierarchy of related
objects itself an object in that hierarchy? Traditional metaphor theory
strains to answer such questions.

In the so-called classical view, metaphors are simply a type of figurative
language. To say "the day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops" is to use
the verb "stand" in a novel linguistic context. Days have no literal legs to
stand on. John Searle, George Lakoff, and Mark Turner, among others, have
argued that metaphors are more broadly a cognitive phenomenon, mapping distinct
ontological categories across "conceptual domains" [@lakoff_metaphors_1980;
@turner_death_1987; @lakoff_contemporary_1998, @searle_metaphor_1998]. In the
modified view, even such basic semantic concepts as "quantity, state, change,
action, cause, purpose, means, modality" are metaphorical in nature
[@lakoff_metaphorical_1980; @lakoff_contemporary_1998, 212]. Lakoff and others
have further argued that beyond figurative, lyrical language, metaphors more
broadly structure everyday experience. Thus the analysis of common phrases like
"things are looking up" and "I can't get that tune out of my mind" reveals the
underlying figuration like "good things are up" and "the mind is a container."
The idea that "good things are up" generates a multitude of metaphors like
"profits are going up" and "moving on up," for example
[@lakoff_metaphorical_1980, 195-198].

!["An exemplary interface for viewing a three dimensional book"

!["Alternate display techniques for information about a big book"
.](images/book-3d.png)[@card_methods_2006,4]

In the cognitive view, the metaphor performs a number of "conventional
mappings from one domain to another" [@lakoff_contemporary_1998, 239]. Lakoff
mentions for example the common trope of "a state is a person," implicit in
the ideas of "friendly" and "hostile" states [@lakoff_contemporary_1998, 243].
This metaphor implies that ideas about agency, emotion, and mental life
usually attached to people can be extended to state actors. Similarly, to say
that someone is "boiling mad," instantiates the common trope of "anger is a
hot liquid in a container." In this case, common known properties attached to
the domain of physics are mapped onto the domain of emotion. Lakoff explains
that such domain mappings tend to also follow a few rules. They are usually
partial and asymmetrical. "Mappings are not arbitrary," he writes, "but
grounded in the body and in everyday experience and knowledge." Finally domain
mappings obey what Lakoff calls the Invariance Principle, by which "the image
schema structure of the source domain is projected onto the target domain in a
way that is consistent with inherent target domain
structure."[^ln1-metalakoff] Keep these rules in mind as they will become
important later on in our conversation.

The kind of resemblances that we have been discussing so far---between the
document and its icon, for example---are further referred to as *structural
metaphors*. "Structural metaphors allow us to do much more than just orient
concepts," Lakoff and Johnson wrote in the 1980s. Grounded in "systematic
correlations within our experience," structural metaphors transfer organizing
principles from one domain to another.[@lakoff_metaphors_1980, 61] Thus to say
"the world is our oyster" is to suggest that something in our approach to
interacting with oysters, likely in a gastronomical situation, resembles our
approach to life [C.f. @lakoff_metaphors_1980, 65-8].<!--The citation makes it
sound like the oyster thing is Lakoff's/Johnson's, but they talk about
time/labor/resource. PRP--> The ease of eating one transfers to the ease of
living in the other. The transferred property implies not just a semantic
similarity, one of meaning, but a structural one, one of interface. The
metaphor suggests the world is arranged like an oyster somehow, that it can be
cracked, and that it contains a tasty hidden morsel within. In this way,
structural metaphors organize one thing in the shape of another. They are tools
for extending insight from a known domain to a lesser known one, holding great
explanatory and exploratory power where simple things like oysters shed light
on complex things like worlds.

<!-- check on structural metaphors to make sure world-oyster is the correct
example -->

In their capacity for exploration and explanation, metaphor machines present
us with a special case of conceptual domain blending in that they enact,
rather than merely suggest, the transference of structuring principles from
one system to another---from "physical libraries" to "electronic workstations
environments," in the above example. Metaphors that can be touched and handled
in some way exist neither wholly in language nor wholly in the mind. Rather,
they operate in action, at hand. John Carrol, one of the pioneers in the field
of human-computer interaction, summarized the role of metaphors in the design
of computing systems as follows:

> Professional programmers might learn a new system X by metaphorizing at least
initially from what they already know about system Y. More casual or naive
end-users might rely on metaphors drawn from more distant knowledge domains,
e.g. on what they have already learned about electric typewriters. [...] The
implications of this proposal are simple and direct. If people employ metaphors
in learning about computing systems, the designers of those systems should
anticipate and support likely metaphorical constructions to increase the ease
of learning and using the system [@carroll_metaphor_1982, 107-108].

In essence, Carroll imagines human-computer interfaces that incorporate
Lakoff's and Johnson's "conceptual blending" in practice. In this way, the
simulacrum of a familiar gesture of discarding a crumpled piece of paper into
the waste bin can guide the deletion of electronic documents.

Apple's influential *Human Interface Guidelines*, at the core of Apple's
desktop interfaces in the 1980s and today, echoes Carroll's proscriptions:

> You can take advantage of people's knowledge of the world around them by
using metaphors to convey concepts and features of your application. Use
metaphors involving concrete, familiar ideas and make the metaphors plain, so
that users have a set of expectations to apply to computer environments.  For
example, people often use file folders to store paper documents in their
offices. Therefore, it makes sense to people to store computer documents in
computer-generated folders that look like file folders. People can organize
their hard disks in a way that's analogous to the way they organize their file
cabinets [@apple_apple_1987, 4].

Apple's designers understood that the mapping of concepts between the physical
and the computer-generated worlds is imperfect. For example, unlike a
real-world file folder, constrained by the size of its containing cabinet, a
computer folder can hold a nearly unlimited amount of files. Or, to be more
precise, the electronic folder metaphor is subject to different constraints
than those that limit the use of paper files. The image of a paper file should
not therefore restrict the possibilities of what can be done to a digital
file, the manual explains. The designer is to "strike a balance between the
metaphor's suggested use and the ability of the computer to support and extend
the metaphor" [@apple_apple_1987, 5]. The user handling a virtual folder must
recognize its capabilities beyond those suggested by its image. Some
attributes of the paper domain map onto the virtual, while other do not.
Furthermore, the virtual contains possibilities not conveyed by the original
vehicle.

A number of patents from IBM, Xerox, and Microsoft similarly evoke the logics
of structural metaphor and domain blending. Consider US Patent #5,907,854 by
Paula J. Cox et.al. of International Business Machines. The invention describes
"a library metaphor that allows a user to organize the online books in a manner
that has meaning and utility." The authors continue to explain that while "the
actual books may be stored in many separate and distinct locations [...] the
bookcase provides a familiar classification system." Further, they write that
the creation of bookcase metaphors must involve "the creation of appropriate
links to the actual online book/bookshelf/bookcase." The "book metaphor"
ultimately "provides an easy to understand and intuitive model for a user who
might not be familiar with on-line viewing tools" [@cox_method_1999].

Another metaphor machine can be found in the collaboration between the
influential product design firm IDEO and Xerox in the 1990s. The two worked on
an early file manager shell called PC Catalog, later renamed TabWorks. In
describing the design process, IDEO developers wrote about defining "key
elements of the metaphor" contained in the image of "tabs" and "catalogs."
"The book *cover*," they wrote, "opened to display three *rings* binding a set
of divider *tabs*, each containing one or more *pages*." Pages, in turn
contained *items* or "icons representing documents or applications"
[@moll-carrillo_articulating_1995, 572]. In a similar binder-based software
application, the engineers at IBM describe the "contents of the notebook
metaphor," which are "displayed as a stack of sheets." "The interface [...]
permits a user to directly manipulate the sheets in the notebook metaphor"
[@glaser_graphical_1995]. In these words we begin to glimpse the trouble with
the structural metaphor paradigm of human-computer interaction. The idea of
"direct manipulation" refers to its *immediate* availability to hand.
Paradoxically, the user handles only the metaphor directly. The actual
notebook is occluded in favor of its representation. This subtle sleight of
hand, by which handling metaphors appears "direct," where metaphors subsume
things, will continue to haunt our conversation.

## Dissimulation

Readers know what paragraphs, pages, files, and folders can do on paper and
would like for digital images of paper to behave in a similar way. The
principles of metaphor-driven design contain an implicit model of
human-computer interaction, which suggests that humans prefer to manipulate
digital information stored on computational media by the means of familiar
mediating structures---paragraphs, pages, files, and folders---associated
figuratively with the affordances of print media. For example, one affordance
of paper is that it can be folded. It therefore becomes possible to "earmark"
a page by folding a corner. The fold enables subsequent recollection of text
that was read previously. By these means, a reader marks a notable place in
the text in order to return to it later. Patently, digital media cannot (as of
yet) fold by the way of paper. Readers seeking a mechanism for digital
recollection may not be familiar with the affordances of the newly inhabited
medium. Consequently, the affordances of digital media are presented through
metaphor. In this way, a virtual "earmark" on a "page" represents a numerical
pointer to a specific address in the computer memory. A "page" stands for a
range of related addresses that correspond roughly to the information visible
on an analogous page in print. Similarly, one "drops a folder into a trash
bin" or "drags and drops a file" or "bookmarks a page" on a screen. Such
metaphors rely on habituated insight with one medium extended into another. We
do not literally "drag" or "drop" bits, but we use metaphors of paper and
trashcans to help us manipulate bits and bytes as if they were household
objects. The metaphor opens figurative possibilities. But, it also obscures
actual physical contingencies of interacting with bits and bytes, logic gates
and electromagnetic traces.

The affordances of physical media differ from those of the simulated. We
handle bits and bytes differently from files and folders, pages and
paragraphs. The metaphorical substitution encourages readers to extend the
facility they have with handling one sort of media (paper and ink) to another
(screen and pixels). What readers gain in facility, they lose in critical
faculty. Alienated from the material conditions of information storage and
retrieval, readers gain access to the metaphor alone. Thus we go through the
motions of "turning the page" but in actuality redraw the screen. We
"highlight a passage," which constitutes an action that may also send
information about the highlighted passage to a data aggregation service. We
"share a book" which really means assigning a temporary license to another
user. Where does the text go? I ask when downloading a paper from an online
journal.[^ln1-nested] It is in your home folder someone answers. But unless
one of us is familiar with the material contingencies of file storage, neither
has a mental map of any physical location corresponding to the "home" folder,
the default location of personal files on many systems. When confronted with
the actual affordances of digital text, the user grasps for neutered
metaphors. We "reside" in such "homes," "own," "share," and "create" only in
the simulacrum.

Interface metaphors conceal structures of algorithmic governance and control
over the transmission of symbolic goods. Print offers a relatively static and
stable medium by comparison. Ink and paper do not change much in transit. By
contrast, the vessels of computation are capable of altering their contents
dynamically. Imagine my asking you to read Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, for
example, in lending you a copy of the text. I am fairly certain that the text
will remain unaltered as I pass the book into your hands. By contrast, the
computed sign adjusts itself to new contexts. An electronic version of
*Hamlet* could adapt to the new reader's geographic location, mood, or
consumption habits. In fact, most texts we consume today come to us in such
computationally constructed way. The front page of the *New York Times* viewed
in Beijing will differ from that viewed in New York. The two "pages" or
"sites" are in some sense two completely different textual variants. In
another sense, the "front page" identifies the same location of the same text,
in two diverging and dynamically composed versions. Whatever is meant by
"today's edition of the *New York Times*" in that sense, denotes differing
surface phenomena that emanate from the same source.

The key to understanding the "loss of resemblances" that accompanies ubiquitous
simulation lies in the inner dynamics of the metaphor machinery. A functioning
metaphor, if you would recall from Lakoff, is one which transfers structural
properties of one domain into another. Thus to say "life is a stage" is to
transpose something about theater onto life. In literary terms, the theater is
"tenor" where "life" is "vehicle" of the composite figure
[@richards_philosophy_1936, 96-7]. Simulations work differently. Where the
tenor of the literary metaphor *transfers* properties across domains, the
computational metaphor *substitutes* them, confusing the "signs of the real for
the real" [@baudrillard_simulacra_1994, 2]. It is a subtle difference that
engenders not-so-subtle effects. For example, it would be one thing to say "you
are the apple of my eye" and quite another to confuse apples for eye pupils.
Baudrillard gives us the example of a map that no longer corresponds to any
territory. He calls such a condition of pure simulation without a referent
hyperreality.

Hyperreality emanates from the momentum of the expected correspondence between
representation and the thing being represented. For example, one expects a
weather simulation to model actual observed meteorological conditions. Would
it still be a weather simulation if the model was broken in some way, or, in
the extreme, if it had no correspondence to the physics of clouds, wind, and
water whatsoever? The hyperreal model breaks further still by usurping,
instead of imitating or merely obscuring, the underlying reality. It begins to
simulate itself, according to its own rules, similar to self, entering a state
of dissimulation. Such dissimulation no longer corresponds to any conditions
"on the ground." Severed from its referent, the sign attains the status of the
thing represented: a map of a map, a symbol that folds onto itself, a weather
simulation confused for weather.

We know that physical affordances of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and
electromagnetic storage differ drastically from those of paper, goat skins, or
parchment. For example, an English-language character occupies eight basic
units of information (bits) on a disk where a print character occupies one
basic unit (letter). The disk can tolerate millions of rewrites, where the
paper medium wears out after only a few. The paper inscription is visible to
the naked eye where the digital inscription is not. Still, the simulation
maintains the illusion of similarity. We encounter what is called
*skeuomorphic* design, by which screen reading retains the ornaments of print.
In this way, an electronic book reader mimics the bent corner of a
well-thumbed book. Skeuomorphic metaphors extend visual cues from one medium
to another. The reader already knows how to turn pages of a book. A book
device therefore simulates pages to ease the cognitive burden of transitioning
from paper to pixel. Instead of issuing arcane commands meant for the machine
to turn the page, readers perform the more habituated motion of swiping across
the screen. The gliding motion enacts a kinetic analogy---a type of a
metaphor---as if to transpose properties of paper to glass.

Our grasp on the medium weakens the more convincing the simulacrum. By
definition, simulation "assume[s] a form resembling that of something else,"
whereby one referent is exchanged for another [@_simulation_2015]. To drag and
drop a document into a trashcan on the screen, for example, should in theory
correspond to an analogous set of data manipulations on the disk. Yet,
"discarding a file" in this manner does not necessarily include deletion of
data from the storage medium, as expected. The representation of the document
may disappear visually where the electromagnetic inscription endures. Such
"loss of resemblances" could remain insignificant. Does one care whether a file
was actually erased or not when performing deletion? Perhaps not. But in some
cases, when it really matters---under the threat of censorship or prosecution,
for example---the incongruence exposes the frailty of our alienation from the
material contexts of digital labor. Under duress, facing unjust prosecution for
example, one may demand the thing to stay deeply deleted. The problem of
metaphoric immediacy reappears in the unfulfilled promise of mimesis. The poet
and the critic may celebrate the free play of the signifier where the
journalist or the accused would not. In many contexts, the metaphoric vehicle
claims to bridge domains and to ferry content across faithfully, without
meddling or damaging its contents. But if the metaphor does meddle---if it
mediates while dissembling and dissimulating---by what process can one ensure
the efficacy of transference? What entity makes good on the promise of
verisimilitude?

Readers ultimately bear the burden of such unverified conceptual transference.
In pretending to turn virtual pages, we lose sight of the mechanisms that give
rise to dissimulation. If we hope to practice anything like interpretation or
close reading at the level of discourse, we must certainly also practice them
at the physical site of discourse formation. A truly materialist poetics would
reach through representation towards the medium. More than superficial
embellishment, the skeuomorphic metaphor enacted at the surface of the digital
literary device structures all higher order meaning-carrying units: from
individual letters to words, paragraphs, chapters, pages, and books. The
metaphor of "turning the page by swiping across the screen" conceals the
structural rift between media: between supple pages and rigid slabs of glass
and silicone.

Why would readers engage in such a charade? Why not simply make use of novel
interfaces afforded by new technology? The literature from the field of
human-computer interaction suggests a formalist answer: habituation [See
@carroll_metaphor_1982; @carroll_interface_1987; @spolsky_user_2001]. The
initial effort it takes to learn to read in a new environment may discourage
potential readers from adopting a new technology. Smart designers therefore
rely on acculturated practice, the turning of pages in our case, to minimize
the "friction" of adoption. Although an "electronic book reader" contains no
pages as such, it extends the metaphor of pages to electronic reading.
A digital poem, a novel, a physician's script, or a legal contract resembles
their paper counterparts in order to enable familiar actions. But while
imitating paper pages, the reading appliance also monitors, adjusts, warns, and
controls.

Dissimulation conceals structuring principles large and small. Some of the
occluded details remain inconsequential, like the limit on how many keys can be
pressed at once without overwhelming the circuitry of the keyboard when typing.
Other concealed details are of paramount importance, like digital rights
management chips and censorship filters, for example. Electronic books are
governed and internalize governing structures in ways that are often
purposefully hidden from the reader. For example, the US Digital Millennium
Copyright Act prohibits the physical circumvention of copyright protections
[See @ku_critique_2004; @ginsburg_legal_2005; @perzanowski_rethinking_2008;
@fry_circumventing_2009; @von_lohmann_unintended_2010]. This means that if an
electronic book is encrypted in some way to prevent copyright infringement, the
reader may also be prevented from examining codes and codices embedded into the
device---rules governing accessibility, preservation, or freedom of speech. The
material affordances of inscription at that deep, bottom-most meaning-bearing
medium influence all higher-level practices of interpretation.[^ln1-rmedium]

Traditional theories of textual interpretation rely on properties and
assumptions attached to print media. For example, in Hans-Georg Gadamer's
influential conception of art, the free play of the artistic mind transforms
into material structure [*Gebilde*] that is both "repeatable" and "permanent"
[@gadamer_truth_1975, 110]. Similarly, in his *Interpretation Theory*, Paul
Ricoeur wrote about the "range of social and political changes" related to the
invention of writing. To the stability of communication in print Ricoeur
attributes the "birth of political rule exercised by a distant state" and "the
birth of market relationships." The constitution of archives enables history,
where the fixity of law, justice. "Such an immense range of effects suggests
that human discourse is not merely preserved from destruction," Ricoeur writes.
It is also "deeply affected in its communicative function"
[@ricoeur_interpretation_1976, 26-8]. The electronic literary device offers no
such permanence. What is meant by "fixed," "permanent," and "repeatable"
changes with the device. Such properties come to us under the guise of surface
representation. Nothing is guaranteed in the passage of electronic text from
one pair of hands into another. Formatting expands its purview far beyond
typographical convention. The erasure of words, word substitution, automatic
summarization, wholesale generation of discourse by algorithmic means---the
command and control layer implicit in all digital media contains all such
possibilities. What does it mean to read and to interpret a dynamic text, which
changes depending on its context? How can literary analysis---close reading,
philology, hermeneutics---persist without the fixity of print?

bit [...] can be translated along the semiconductor [...] sweeping the
minority carriers with it. The quantum can be detected by a simple capacitive
couple, e.g., a floating gate FET"
.](images/floating-gate.png)[@boyle_information_1974]

Dissimulation is perhaps necessary, because the reading and writing of digital
data can involve processes far outside of everyday experience. For example, in
reading data from solid state (FLASH) memory, a circuit imparts electrical
charge through quantum tunneling onto a connected series of floating gate
transistors [See @pavan_flash_1997; @bez_introduction_2003]. Whatever the
complexities of solid state storage architecture, the difference in the
structure of information on pages and floating gates is apparent. The
arrangement of one has only an arbitrary connection to the other. Consequently
changes in the structure of the symbolic domain, which manifest in the erasure
of words on the screen for example, do not necessitate corresponding changes in
the physical domain, which in the same example manifest in the discharge of the
floating gate. The information endures despite the intended erasure. Dwellers
of virtual realms believe in verisimilitude as a matter of faith. We hope for
the analogy of turning pages or erasing words on the screen to entail similar
actions on the disk. But we waiver when asked to authenticate the particulars
of the simulation. At times, "erased" data is simply hidden from view. At other
times, instead of disappearing it proliferates across deep surfaces, shared
without consent with agents not privy to the original contexts of inscription.
As was the case with Baudrillard's map, the metaphor of reading and writing
digitally breaks in that it no longer resembles any familiar terrain.
Dissimulation mimics familiar materialities absent their actual physics. It
suggests a structuring of one kind, while enacting the structure of another.

In these novel conditions, the task of the literary scholar must include,
among other things, a practice of microscopic reading that corresponds to the
techniques of micromolecular writing, suggested already in Kittler and
Baudrillard in the 1990s [@kittler_there_1995]. I imagine here the inverse of
Kittler's literature without humans: cryptic, illegible, and under the
conditions of high technology. The methodology of computational poetics
insists on recovering the shape of the inscription, across surfaces and
domains, making the full extent of the dissimulating figure available for
interpretation.

What happens in the metaphorical transformation between a book---or any
inscription---as cognitive artifact and the apparatus simulating that artifact?
Estrangement, the exegesis of the metaphor, can help reveal the mechanisms of
governance in the structural transference from one medium to another.
Materialist poetics can subsequently allow one to consent, or, conversely,
resist elements of imposed structure. That is not to say that meaning-making
structures can ever become fully transparent or produce plain, unambiguous
meaning. Unlike a cypher, the plain text is one that does not preclude the
possibility of interpretation or misinterpretation. In the continuum between
total legibility and illegibility, the digital texts that we read today occupy
a space somewhere right of center. They are illegible in part. The simulation
of print, the digital metaphor, decays rapidly with time. Archivists know this
problem well: digital texts from the recent past can quickly become
inaccessible as the software used to decode them itself passes into oblivion.

## Death and Incongruence

In poetics, a metaphor is said to be "motivated" when a number of concepts
from one domain extends into another to produce insight
[@lakoff_contemporary_1998, 210-1]. Lakoff explains that to say "to spin one's
wheels" when referring to someone who is thinking is to apply the reader's
knowledge of automobiles to the mental realm. Wheels that spin without moving
the vehicle forward waste energy. The metaphor suggests that something similar
happens mentally as well [@lakoff_contemporary_1998, 211]. A metaphor in a
figurative genre, prose or poetry, suggests novel and hitherto unexplored
connections between domains.

In his influential essay on metaphor the English literary critic I.A. Richards
wrote that "when we use metaphor we have two thoughts of different things
active together and supported by a single word, or phrase, whose meaning is a
resultant of their interaction" [@richards_philosophy_1936, 95]. Richards's
radical contribution to the study of metaphor lay in the observation that
metaphor operates in language, thought, and action ubiquitously. It does not,
as previously thought, exist merely in the realm of poetic language. Thought
in itself, Richards believed, is metaphoric in that the mind continually
searches for patterns and comparisons [@richards_philosophy_1936, 94]. The
motivated metaphor produces insight: a tool to explore and to make sense of
the world. By such means the known sheds light onto the unknown.

Some metaphors are, in this figurative way, more productive than others. The
poetic use of the metaphor does not merely carry meaning across known
domains---it produces new and unexpected connections between them. To this
effect, Richards cites the poet Percy Shelley who wrote the following in
defense of poetry:

> [poetic] language is vitally metaphorical; that is, it marks the before
> unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension, until
> the words which represent them, become, through time, signs for portions or
> classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then if no
> new poets should arise to create afresh the associations which have been
> thus disorganized, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of human
> intercourse [@shelley_essays_1840].

In highlighting the continually regenerative power of the poetic metaphor,
Shelley anticipated what the cognitive school of metaphor theory was to
confirm by empirical means more than a century later [@mojtabai_delusion_2000;
@billig_metaphor_2005]. Metaphors do not "die" as such. They continue to live,
but also become naturalized: that is, understood literally. They create
connections, which with time become habituated and invisible. Taken for
literal truth, the metaphor loses its quality of mediation or literally
"ferrying across."[^ln1-greek] For example, for many readers the idea of a
"dead metaphor" itself no longer evokes death. The metaphor withers: once the
connotation is lost it becomes a denotative statement lacking any exploratory
or explanatory potential. In Shelley's view, all metaphors are destined to
become habituated in this way, only to be reborn again in poetry. In their
most generative form, metaphors produce new meaning. The creative
juxtaposition between two as before unrelated conceptual domains brings novel
aspects of experience to light. With time, the poetic metaphor degrades into a
tired cliché. It no longer "perpetuates understanding." It dies in a sense of
becoming an instrumental shortcut, a commonplace. In the words of Viktor
Shklovsky: we "cease to experience" the trope. The metaphor "dries up" when we
recognize it without apprehension [@shklovsky_voskreshenie_1914]. It no longer
generates new connections between domains, but merely reinforces existing
ones. Vilém Flusser put it another way in writing that habituated idiom
proceeds "smoothly," giving us no pause, without "bumps or interruptions"
[@flusser_freedom_2003, 13 and 82].

Lakoff famously took exception to the idea of dead metaphors, arguing that
even those metaphors that are thoroughly habituated can play a vital part in
structuring everyday experience. He gave the example of the sentence: *He
still can't quite grasp the basic ideas of quantum mechanics*. Grasping, in
this case, is used as a synonym to "understanding." It indicates a
transference of properties between physical (grasping) and mental
(understanding) realms. Despite being commonplace, the metaphor is alive,
Lakoff argued, because it continues to perform a function, naming a mental
activity that we would otherwise find difficult to explain with precision.
Such a metaphor is less dead than other, perhaps more novel, "one off" poetic
tropes that fail to circulate widely [@lakoff_death_1987]. The metaphor dies
in the sense of being overused, but it dies also in another sense for not
being used at all.

A truly dead metaphor for Lakoff is one in which the original source image no
longer makes sense. He gives the example of the English word *pedigree*, which
originally referred to the French for "crane's foot," or *pied de grue*. The
foot was historically used in a typographical flourish to decorate familial
tree diagrams. In the previous example, when we spoke of the metaphorical
"grasping" of ideas, both sides of the domain transference were readily
available to us. We understood something about grasping things and extended it
to the capacity of the mind to take hold of ideas. By contrast, the average
English speaker no longer perceives the *pied de grue* contained within the
English *pedigree*. In the case of a commonplace, the metaphor is merely tired
from frequent use, where it is completely dead in the crane's foot example.
All habituated metaphors like "grasping ideas" and "pedigree" lose a measure
of their symbolic connotation with time. Unlike "pedigree," the metaphorical
nature of "grasping ideas" is at least available for casual interpretation.
According to Lakoff, the underlying metaphor "the mind is like a hand"
generates other meaningful phrases like "you have to *let go* of this idea."
The crane's foot in the English "pedigree" has stopped generating novel
connections. The conventional notion of dead metaphors, Lakoff objects, does
not appropriately differentiate between the two cases of metaphor dysfunction
[@lakoff_death_1987; @muller_metaphors_2008]. The metaphor sometimes "dies"
but continues to produce new linkages, as is the case with grasping ideas. At
other times, the metaphor dies in the sense of one domain becoming no longer
accessible to its user, as is the case with pedigree.

Furthermore, note that a wholly unmotivated metaphor does not live at all.
Thus the Mad Hatter poses his famous nonsensical riddle in Lewis Carroll's
*Alice in Wonderland*: How is a raven like a writing desk? The complete
dissimilarity between the two domains---of animals and furniture---prevents
any productive congruence.[^ln1-carroll] No domain mapping happens between
ravens and writing desks. Not having been born, the metaphor dies in yet
another sense.

With these comments on broken and dead metaphors in mind, I return to the kind
of metaphors we have been discussing earlier in the chapter---the kind found
on computer screens---to ask: How does the interface metaphor live or die by
the above definitions?

When discarding a document into the wastepaper basket, to return to our
recurring example, users should theoretically map their knowledge of paper
documents and paper waste baskets onto the computational domain. The icon
should work similarly to the object it purports to simulate. Instead, the
*idea* of discarding something substitutes for the *material reality* of the
corresponding action. The concept (of discarding something physical) blends
not with another conceptual domain (erasing data) but with the contingent
material affordances of the target medium (solid state storage). Such material
affordances---our ability to actually erase data, for example---stand in an
arbitrary relationship to the depicted figure. We expect the thing to be
deleted, but it is not. One "empties the dustbin," but has no means to verify
whether the transference of properties took place or not. This incongruence, a
breakdown of trust in domain transference, violates Lakoff's Invariance
Principle, which, if you would recall, describes the projection of structure
from the source domain *in a way that is consistent with the inherent
structure of target domain* @lakoff_contemporary_1998, 215] Whatever
structural transformations visible in the source domain do not carry over to
the target. The metaphor breaks almost as badly as the transference between
desks and ravens. Absent the corresponding erasure of data, the act of
"emptying the trashcan" ceases to be a metaphor at all; it illustrates nothing
in particular. As was the case with the "crane's foot" in the English
"pedigree," the handler of the simulated dustbin is missing one part of the
metaphor equation.  Where with "pedigrees" English speakers fail to grasp the
source or the tenor of metaphoric substitution, the virtual dustbin is missing
the target, or the vehicle of the action. Discarding a document into the
virtual dustbin may not in fact correspond to a similar action in the target
domain of the storage medium. Failing to achieve transference between source
and target domains, the metaphor ceases to function. Worse yet: the
transferred properties are not simply missing in transit, they are manifestly
misrepresented.

## Mimesis

"An interface is by nature a form of artistic imitation: a *mimesis*," Brenda
Laurel wrote in her important 1984 essay "Interface as Mimesis." She went on
to write that "if designing interfaces feels like painting on cave walls by
flickering torchlight, it is only because we, the designers, have not availed
ourselves of better illumination: the science of the mimetic arts, poetics"
[@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 67]. Laurel, who started her academic career
in theater studies, went on to work for Apple, Activision, Atari, and Sun
Microsystems among other companies. Her work, widely cited in technical
literature, reminds us of the close connection between poetics and the
architecture of human-computer interaction. It is all the more important
today, as immersive computational environments begin to structure experience
beyond the merely instrumental. Computers increasingly mediate in the
interface between the public and the private, art and politics, mind and body.
The simulacrum requires that we advance a reflective "science of the mimetic
arts" lest we lose a sense of what Michael Taussig has called the "space
ulterior to mimesis" [@taussig_mimesis_1993, 129-144]. The suspension of
disbelief must remain, as it was in Samuel Coleridge's original formulation, a
willful act, containing further a "semblance of truth" required to animate the
shadows of imagination [@coleridge_biographia_1917, 6-7]. An involuntary or
worse yet forced suspension of disbelief can only lead to a state of total
critical disempowerment.

The history of human-computer interaction passes through several distinct
stages, defined by their relationship to representation:

A) Early computers were programmed by physically manipulating a complex
arrangement of wires and relays. With time, that configuration could be
abstracted into symbolic states, signified by visible marks on paper and later
invisible electromagnetic marks on tape. In the next stage of development, the
physical arrangement of gates and relays was further codified into an
artificial language. The programmer operated with a constrained vocabulary,
receiving messages in response, in a dialog resembling human communication.

B) As the use of computers spread, the paradigm of so called "direct interaction"
shifted emphasis from verbal cues to visual and from symbol to icon. The
communication was and continues to be direct in the sense of felt immediacy
and immersion.  By comparison to the verbal symbol, the icon appears to have a
relationship to the remote materialities of machine state less arbitrary than
the symbol.

C) Finally, one imagines an indexical connection between human and machine, by
which brain states and machine states could correspond through a physical
rather than merely visual linkage. The so called direct neural interfaces
bypass inscription---word and picture---altogether, making use of
neuroprosthetics---implants and surface electrodes---to connect human and
machine.

It would be a mistake however to accept the insistence on "directness" at face
value or to understand the arc of this historical trajectory as one that leads
the gradual loss of mediation. In the transition between brain states and
machine configurations, a morphological grammar always intercedes. The grammar
sets the rules of engagement. The growing sense of immediacy of computational
mimesis underscores the political importance of holding the mechanisms of
mediation in critical view.

Before the 1980s, the dominant paradigm of interacting with machines was the
dialog [@shaw_joss:_1964; @cameron_dialog:_1967; @gaines_timesharing_1986;
@martin_computerized_1970; @martin_design_1973]. Already in 1950, Alan Turing
imagined a conversation between an artificially intelligent poet and its
critic:

>`Interrogator:` In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare
thee to a summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better?  
>`Witness:` It wouldn't scan.  
>`Interrogator:` How about "a winter's day," That would scan all right.  
>`Witness:` Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day.  
>`Interrogator:` Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?  
>`Witness: In a way.  
>`Interrogator:` Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think Mr. Pickwick
would mind the comparison.  
>`Witness:` I don't think you're serious. By a winter's day one means a typical
winter's day, rather than a special one like Christmas
[@turing_computing_1950].

The goal of conversational programming was to provide a similarly naturalized
dialog between the operator and the machine. Although machine understanding of
informal human speech does not develop in earnest until the twenty-first
century, interactive computing environments like DIALOG and JOSS were designed
to lessen the cognitive burden of speaking machine languages by translating
them into dialog systems that understood a limited number of English words.
JOSS, an experimental on-line computing system created by the RAND corporation
in 1963, consisted of a typewriter connected to the JOHNNIAC computer. Prior
to JOSS, programmers would interact with the JOHNNIAC machine via keyboard and
punch card, initially using octal number notation and then binary assembly
language [@gruenberger_history_1979]. These methods of programming were time
consuming and prone to error. "An octal desk calculator was nice to have," a
historian of the system would later quip [@gruenberger_history_1979, 58]. 

The JOSS experiment introduced the idea of an "interpreter" that sat between
the human operator and the machine, facilitating communication in a friendly,
conversational manner. Think of JOSS as the "user's computing aide and a
single contact with the computer," the engineers wrote [@shaw_joss:_1964,
456]. Instead of feeding punch cards into the mechanism, as was done before,
the operator would now use a standard typewriter. Instead of flipping switches
the operator typed words. JOSS thus referred both to the "simple language" for
machine instruction and to this new "remote console" way of interacting with
the computer. JOSS and the user would "take turns controlling the typewriter"
in the words of the documentation. The interpreter understood simple commands
like `do`, `go`, and `type`, which it would then translate into machine
instructions. When encountering an unspecified command, the interpreter
mimicked human confusion, responding simply: "Eh?  [@shaw_joss:_1964]"

This mode of conversational interaction was captured also in one of the
earliest text adventure games, the *Colossal Cave Adventure*, designed by Will
Crowther in 1975 [@montfort_twisty_2003]. The following dialog illustrates the
call-and-response game play typical of the genre:

> `You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around
you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.`
>
>`> enter`
>
> `You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring. There are some
keys on the ground here. There is a shiny brass lamp nearby. There is food
here. There is a bottle of water here.`
>
>`> get keys`
>
> `OK`
>
>`> get lamp`
>
> `OK`
>
>`> exit`
>
> `You're at end of road again.`

Although much more accessible and interactive than communication in octal or
binary machine code, the conversational model posed several significant
challenges to the machine user. It resembled human communication in all its
richness and variety, where in fact the machine "spoke" and "understood" only
a limited number of words. Researchers from the U.S. Air Force academy would
write:

> The lower cost of computer access and the proliferation of on-line systems
produced a new breed of users, people whose expertise was in some area other
than computer technology. As their initial fascination with conversational
computing wore off, users reported experiencing feelings of intense
frustration and of being "manipulated" by a seemingly unyielding, rigid,
intolerant dialogue partner [@walther_-line_1974, 379;
@gaines_timesharing_1986, 15].

The conversational intermediary of Colossal Cave Adventure understood roughly
295 commands, and knew about 1,600 words in response, arranged into several
hundred canned phrases.[^ln1-count] Faced with an unfamiliar word, it could
only repeat "That's not a verb I recognise."

By the 1980s, a new breed of metaphorical interfaces gained widespread
prominence. If *Colossal Cave Adventure* epitomized the conversational model
of computing, games like the early but popular Pong, Space Invaders, and
Donkey Kong heralded the paradigm of "direct manipulation." According to Ben
Shneiderman, the researcher who coined the term in 1982, direct manipulation
involved three key principles:

1. Continuous representation of the object of interest.
2. Physical actions or labelled button presses instead of complex syntax.
3. Rapid incremental reversible operations whose impact on the object of
interest is immediately visible [@shneiderman_future_1982, 251;
@hutchins_direct_1986, 91].

The primary goal of direct manipulation was therefore to achieve the
correspondence between "representation" and the "object of interest."
Shneiderman looked to Leibniz for guidance. He wrote: Leibniz developed a
system of symbolic notation, at the root of his calculus, to "express the
exact nature of a thing briefly and, as it were, picture it." For Leibniz, the
symbol, an accurate and portable picture of an idea, could subsequently reduce
the mental effort required for abstract thought, leading to a "great advantage
for discovery" [@leibniz_briefwechsel_1899, 375; @shneiderman_direct_1983,
57]. Symbolic notation made it possible for mathematicians to represent
infinitely small and infinitely large numbers in print---ideas that would not
otherwise fit on the page or in the mind [@cajori_history_1923;
@thurston_leibnizs_1973; @grabiner_is_1974]. For Shneiderman and others, a
computer game like Pong similarly enabled the direct manipulation of complex
abstractions, making it possible for a player to control a virtual
table-tennis paddle by rotating a physical knob on a gaming console. The
movement of the physical knob corresponded "directly" to the movement of the
paddle---clockwise for up and counter-clockwise for down---thus achieving the
correspondence between "operation" and the "impact on the object of interest"
[@shneiderman_direct_1983, 60]. Without such a "direct" linkage, the physics
of the game simulation would be too complex for players to handle effectively,
were they asked to play by writing formulas in code, for example, or to direct
the paddle through dialog, in conversation.

Direct manipulators argued that the arbitrary nature of the sign to its
signifier hindered the conversational model of human-computer interaction. In
this way, when using *EMACS*, a text editor commonly found on UNIX systems of
the time, one would enter the command `k` in combination with other keys to
delete or to "kill" a file, while on other systems, Shneiderman complained,
`k` stood for "keep a file," the opposite from killing it
[@shneiderman_direct_1983, 65]. In the conversational model, the command
stands in a contingent relationship to the intended effect, whereas in the
direct manipulation model the knob and the movement of the paddle relate
mimetically. In the language of Peircean semiotics, the direct manipulation
paradigm favors the "iconic" relationship between representation and the
object of interest, by which the two relate through shared elements of
structure and composition [@peirce_algebra_1992; @jakobson_few_1977;
@norman_user_1986, 110]. Consider the game controller for Pong. The movement
of the knob mimics the movement of the paddle it represents. Like an
onomatopoeic word, the one resembles and imitates the other. The relationship
between paddle and knob is somewhat less arbitrary than in ordinary language,
where words do not resemble the things they represent. The central idea of
direct manipulation involved an attempt to move past conversational
contingency. Where there are numerous ways to instruct the machine to return a
serve, the knob limits the player's instrumental vocabulary to two axes.

In their field-defining work on human-computer interaction, Edwin Hutchins,
Donald Norman, and James Hollan wrote:

> There is an economy here [referring to direct manipulation] in that
the user's knowledge of the structure of the surface acoustical form has a
non-arbitrary relationship to meaning [...] The same sort of thing can be done
in the design of interface languages [@norman_cognitive_1991, 123].

Influenced by insights from cognitive metaphor theory about structural domain
mapping, direct manipulators thought the mimetic icon to require less
explanation than an arbitrary symbol. The transference of iconic qualities is
intuited; the icon presents its own explanation.[^ln1-icon] Instead of
searching a "dictionary" of available commands for the right verb the user can
rely on the habituated affordances of real-world objects, like table tennis
paddles and paper trashcans, to manipulate virtual objects, like computer
games and file systems. The move between "conversational" and "direct"
interaction models of human-computer interaction can thus be viewed as a shift
from a system of symbolic signs which stand in arbitrary relationship to their
referents to a system of iconic signs that stand in a mimetic
relationship.[^ln1-peirce]

Crucially, the advocates of direct manipulation aimed to suspend disbelief.
The feeling of directness came through the complete immersion into the mimetic
context of a virtual world [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 76]. In this way,
the mimetic icon usurps the "object of interest" through use. The icon of a
document becomes the writer's object of interest, at the expense of the
inscription itself. Direct manipulation theory imagines the handling of
representations, not objects---as evidenced by the somewhat strained language
of metaphor machines in which "hierarchies allow access to metaphors within
the library" and "users manipulate sheets in the notebook metaphor"
[@pajak_electronic_1992; @glaser_graphical_1995]. It is direct in the sense of
concealing the mediated nature of virtual experience. The goal is to
manufacture what Laurel and others call an "interactive mimesis" and "first
personness," the experience of "directly living and acting within the world
established by the computer" [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986;
@norman_user_1986, 490-1]. Hutchins, Hollan, and Norman write: "when an
interface presents world of action rather than a language of description,
manipulating a representation can have the same effects and the same feel as
manipulating the thing being represented" [@hutchins_direct_1986, 98-99]. The
actual instruments enabling the manipulation of image or word---keyboards,
screens, and machine instructions---are meant to disappear. "The user of a
well-designed *model world* interface can willfully suspend disbelief that the
objects depicted are artifacts of some program and can thereby directly engage
the world of the objects," Norman et.al. write [@hutchins_direct_1986, 99]. In
this view, the dialogic model of tool use encouraged by *Colossal Cave
Adventure*---`get keys`, `get lamp`---stands in the way. Instead of working
with objects of interest, instead of being a part of the story, the
protagonist is "using the computer" [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 74]. "End
users are not interested in *making* representations," Laurel wrote. "They
want to move around *inside* one," favoring the mimetic context over their
actual, physical surroundings [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 75]. Verbal
representations, like `get keys` or `get lamp`, puncture the first-person
illusion. By contrast, the fully immersive model supports the "sensation of
directness," in which direct, that is iconic, expressions, "behave in such a
way that a user can assume that they, in some sense, *are* the things they
refer to" [@hutchins_direct_1986, 110].

The principles of direct interaction that emerge in the 1980s stood against
what Laurel called the "ill-formed" presence of the mediator, in the
interfaces of the previous era like JOSS and *Colossal Cave Adventure*. For
those advocating the direct interaction paradigm of computer use,
conversational computing prevented the unmediated "pleasure" and "catharsis"
of direct engagement [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 75]. The intermediary
takes the place of the player in a game: it swings the sword for her, takes a
beating, and reports on the experience, standing in the way of immediacy.
Laurel writes:

> In the file management example, the intermediary takes the form of command
menus that are invoked in order to activate processes in the program that will
create the desired results. The user does not have the experience of pushing
files around, stowing them and grabbing them, or blowing them away. Instead,
the user has the experience of communicating with the file management
intermediary [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 75].

In combination, the ideas behind cognitive domain blending and direct
manipulation gave rise to the now ubiquitous WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
get) interfaces, put into mass production by Apple, Xerox, and other companies
in the early- to mid-1980s. The Xerox 8010 Star workstation introduced in 1981
and the Xerox 6085 Daybreak workstation, introduced in 1985, heralded the era
of accessible, metaphor-driven personal computing, characterized by the use of
virtual graphical objects like windows, icons, desktops, folders, and buttons.
The Star and Daybreak workstations were some of the earliest machines to put
the principles of metaphoric domain blending and direct manipulation into
action. The interface was meant to "reveal the structure" of the simulated
objects intuitively, without training or lengthy written explanation. In
Laurel's words, the mimetic interface employed "logic and aesthetics to create
representations that *engage* humans in pleasurable ways"
[@laurel_brenda_interface_1986, 85]. The mimetic context is simply "the
experience we desire," Laurel wrote. Direct participation enabled actors to
feel "the full pleasure of the mimetic form" [@laurel_brenda_interface_1986,
75].

Designers advocating direct manipulation understood the compromise that came
with the emphasis on such immersive and pleasurable experiences
[@hutchins_direct_1986, 118]. Effective mimesis relies on the user's
familiarity with the source domain. In this way, we understand what to do with
virtual "folder" icons because we know how paper folders behave in real life.
Direct mimetic manipulation does not however tell us anything new about the
capabilities of virtual folders. Immersion precludes critical reflection
beyond the pre-defined confines of the modeled world. The user has access only
to what the simulated experience allows and can provide. Like a theme park
ride it is a guided experience, which can only lead to predetermined
results.

Problematically, ideas behind mimetic immersion contain a kind of a logical
fallacy. The literature on direct manipulation often refers to the example of
driving a car to illustrate the type of an interface by which inputs and
outputs correlate directly. Thus instead of giving complicated commands to a
vehicle, a driver turns the wheel to the right, and the car immediately
follows. A direct causal link exists between the steering wheel and the car's
axle. Similarly, when operating a computer game like Space Invaders via a
joystick, the player experiences the immediate correspondence between the
movement of the controlling mechanism and movement of the player-controlled
space ship on the screen. The car is the "direct object of interest" for a
driver, just like the virtual space ship is for a gamer. Unlike video game
players, authors attempting to delete sensitive information---to return to our
simple and reoccurring example---are not interested in the virtual
representation of their documents. The object of their interest is not
mimetic. They want to erase the document itself, located somewhere within the
machine. In cases like these, inhabitants of the simulated, virtual world have
an interest in objects outside of it. The paradigm of direct manipulation
instead veils the object from view, suspending the rules of physical
interaction in favor of the virtual. Far from being direct, the iconic
representation of the document---the image of a file---usurps the physical
object, the file itself.  Where in the conversational paradigm the nature of
the mediation was at hand, open to circumspection, "direct manipulation"
occludes the mechanisms of mimesis.

The trajectory from direct *physical* manipulation to direct *virtual*
manipulation leads to the totalizing loss of resemblances and designations
that Baudrillard warned us about. At its logical extreme, the simulacrum
supplants the thing being simulated. It appears as hyper-reality, the
experience of unmediated interaction without awareness or sense of the
underlying referent. All "objects of interest" within such a model world are
fabricated objects. They are thus limited to the external, artificial
constraints imposed by their makers. Manufactured experiences present us, the
"users," with compelling, possibly cathartic, metaphors. The metaphor extends
far beyond entertainment, subsuming all spheres of social activity mediated by
computers. The manipulation of metaphors---a reflective, not merely
circumspect inhabitance of virtual worlds---therefore requires not just a
willing suspension of disbelief, but also a poetics: hermeneutics, close
reading, distant reading, deconstruction, morphology, in short precisely the
legacy of interpretive practice that stretches from Aristotle to Susan Sontag
and beyond. The suspension of disbelief otherwise threatens to become a
permanent condition, alienating as it is pleasurable or cathartic.

The history of human-computer interaction began with the manipulation of
physical switches, first by hand and then by proxy, through removable storage
media like paper tape and punch card. The next phase was dialogic and
conversational. Conversational computing introduced the idea of a mediating
agent, an interpreter, who could translate from a limited number of natural
human language commands into the specialized vocabulary of signals that
changed machine configuration states. The "direct manipulation" school of
human-computer interaction dispensed with visible machine states, leading us
further towards immersive mimesis in which virtual environments resemble
real-world objects and their properties. Viewing that history in light of
metaphor theory, I find myself with Plato, Baudrillard, and Taussig,
suspicious of a totalizing mimesis: the more compelling the simulation, the
more removed from its material contexts, the more concealed the logistics of
its production.

## Speculative Formalism

To what extent do we need to view and understand the mechanisms of the machine
that gives rise to the metaphor? In a paper remarking on "The Genesis and
Speed of Telegraph Codes" published in the *Proceedings of the American
Philosophical Society* in 1949, the author noted that "the practical upper
limits of [telegraph transmission] speed will also be limited by the ability
of some human beings to operate a keyboard, until such time as electrical
connection be made direct with the receiver's central nervous system"
[@halstead_genesis_1949, 451].

At the time of writing this book, our society stands at the threshold of a new
paradigm of interacting with computers and hence with each other. Direct brain
to computer interfaces are common enough today to be turned into a
toy.[^ln3-mindflex] Early brain-computer interfaces relied on either imprecise
"noisy" electroencephalographic (EEG) scalp sensors or on electrode implants
that required invasive surgery. In 2004 a team of scientists developed a way
of controlling "a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately"
using electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the
brain [@leuthardt_braincomputer_2004; @miller_spectral_2007]. And in 2015, a
quadriplegic woman piloted an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter using her brain in a
simulation developed by the University of Pittsburgh's Human Engineering
Research Laboratories in collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) [@collinger_collaborative_2014; @prabhakar_how_2015].

On the surface, the advance of brain-computer interfaces seems to bring us
closer to the trajectory of growing immediacy: witness the "no interface"
movement in graphic design and its continuing promise of ever more direct
interaction. *No Interface*, *Don't Make me Think*, and *Hooked: How to Build
Habit-Forming Products* are some of best written and best selling titles
advancing this argument [@krug_dont_2014; @eyal_hooked:_2014;
@krishna_best_2015]. Military applications aside, we must prepare for a future
in affective, mystical arts, the ultimate loss of references and resemblances,
where works of art are to be experienced emotively past the senses: literature
without language or representation, painting beyond media,
asemiosis---messages lacking a sign.

However futuristic such possibilities may seem to us today, we should not lose
sight of the mediated nature of human-computer interaction in all of its
forms: paper, ink, code, silicone. Media intercedes. As technological dreams
become reality they also grow less interesting and more mundane. We tend not
to think about them; they become habit. Habituation smoothes the rough edges
of irreconcilability between human and machine. The tool recedes from view,
beginning to seem a natural and direct extension of the body. I do not mean to
dismiss the mastery of those engaged in creating the illusion of directness.
Pleasure and catharsis are important in some contexts. In other contexts, we
must privilege critical thought, analysis, and interruption. Computational
poetics aims to arrest the encounter: to make it seem less natural, to bring
the receding media to light, and to expose the mediating systems supporting
the simulation.

Heidegger calls such a process the disruption of reference or a *breach*. He
writes:

> When something at hand is missing whose everyday presence was a matter of
course that we never even paid attention to it, this constitutes a *breach* in
the context of references discovered in our circumspection. Circumspection
comes up with emptiness and now sees for the first time what the missing thing
was at hand *for* and at hand *with*. Again the surrounding world makes itself
known [@heidegger_being_1996, 70].

The momentary breach, a measure of discomfort in the fit between bodies,
keyboards, and screens ensures our ability to shape the encounter on our own,
tactical terms: to opt in when useful and to opt out when necessary. I am not
concerned here with the metaphysical entailments of a possible posthuman
future. The illusion of directness belies the very human mechanisms of command
and control. The simulation ultimately embodies specific power structures in
an economy of exchange between physical and mental resources. In this market
there are those who extract rents from virtual, mimetic inhabitance and those
whose dwelling becomes a commodity.

Recall in this regard the Heideggerian insight into the mediated nature of
tool use. In *Being and Time*, Heidegger wrote about the particular
*handiness* of a tool, like a hammer. He writes, "the less we stare at the
thing [...] the more actively we use it, the more original our relation to it
becomes and the more undisguisedly it is encountered as what it is, a useful
thing" [@heidegger_being_1996, 65]. For Heidegger, a tool like a hammer had to
be understood through use. It was inaccessible to reason or theory alone. The
hammer comes into focus through what he called *circumspection*
[*Umsicht*]---the peripheral awareness of the object ready-to-hand
[*zuhanden*] [@heidegger_sein_1967, 69]. One relates to the tool in the
process of manipulating it, while concentrating on the task at hand: the
seamster is not interested in the needle, only in the work of sewing
[@heidegger_being_1996, 65]. Later, Heidegger would connect his account of
tool use with philosophy itself, as a mode of truth seeking or unconcealment
[@heidegger_question_1977, 319]. When used properly, the tool reveals some
truth about the world, about itself, and about the person using it. In this
sense the Greek *techne* is for Heidegger related to *poiesis*, or bringing
forth.

Contrary to the kind of technology that reveals and brings forth, Heidegger
describes also the use of machines and apparatus that conceals and blocks
poiesis. Such tools determine rather than reveal in the sort of a "destined"
revealing that can unfold only along a predetermined narrative, in which the
answer is already given. The forester that walks the woods simply to cut them
down can only reveal its nature as a commodity, in what Heidegger calls a
"standing reserve." The forester who measures the felled timber becomes
subordinate to the organization of cellulose. The wood is challenged forth by
the need of paper, the paper to the press. The press consequently organizes
the public, set on "swallowing what is printed, so that a set configuration of
opinion becomes available on demand." In following the path of a determined
narrative, technology turns the human into human resource. It is in that
sense, that Heidegger concludes that modern technology is "no more a human
doing" [@heidegger_question_1977, 323-4]. Ultimately, proscribed tool use
strips users of their powers of self-determination. They learn nothing new
about themselves or the world.

To insist on mediation is to breach the continuity between body and
prosthesis, human and machine, nature and technology. It is to hold the tool
in view, to use in the active voice, to determine its aims, and to destine
rather than to be destined.

I would like to imagine in conclusion the possibility of indexical interfaces,
the kind of signs that connect to their objects of interest through palpable
causal linkages like smoke and fire, tissue damage and pain. Is it possible,
in other words, to inhabit virtual worlds while keeping the scaffolding of the
simulation in view, to connect viscerally to the material conditions of habit
production? The question is of vital political importance, because whether we
have answers or not, implements of symbolic manipulation---books and pens that
once lay safely at an arm's length---move inevitably closer to the mind's eye.
For now, the screen and the hard drive, mechanisms of memory storage and image
projection, remain extrinsic to the body. They are at this moment still
amenable to circumspection. But the gap is closing fast. The political
consequences of our technological choices become more difficult to reveal in
proportion to their habituation. Today, people who forego the use of
electronic tablets, smart phones, laptops, and notebooks could seem merely
whimsical or quaint. What if tomorrow they be judged mentally deficient or
barred from participating fully in the public life?

The human is endangered not by technology, Heidegger wrote, but by its
determination. At stake is precisely an insistence on drawing essential
boundaries in a way that precludes revealment, the autonomous search for truth
[@heidegger_question_1977, 331-4]. The ability to read and to write was always
politically fraught because of its potential to determine the human
experience. It is by no accident that the struggle for universal literacy
accompanied most political revolutions. Poets are important to the revolution
not because they create beautiful aesthetic objects, but because they retain
the non-instrumental, emancipatory potential of reading and writing. What can
be said in parallel about digital literacy, the poetry of embodied and
embedded devices? What if we fail to develop a sense of computational poetics
in the face of frenzied instrumental development of computer technology? How
can one empty the hand, the mind, in breach of technesis? And what will the
emptiness signify: for whom and who with?

create the illusion of a single text.

alteration irradiates in every direction, affecting in a decisive manner all
the factors and functions" [@ricoeur_interpretation_1976, 26].
