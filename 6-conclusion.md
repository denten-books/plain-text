# Conclusion: Human Grounds for Computation

As I write these words, a receiver of a pacemaker implant fights for her right
to access its software, in her words "to know what code is running inside my
body" [@mcgowan_i_2016]. In Pakistan, the American National Security
agency-sponsored Skynet program places people on the US-sanctioned
"disposition matrix" or "kill list" based on predictive analytics: social
network analysis, cellular machine learning, patterns of travel and telephone
use. Automated tools with names like SMARTTRACKER, SMARTCHART, and Cloud
Travel Analytic "select" people for "target strikes" by unmanned areal
vehicles  [@mcneal_targeted_2014; @weber_keep_2016]. Willingly, or not, we are
engaged in the political struggle for the control and the deployment of these
codified resources. The heart and the sky are sites on which the tactics of
inscription are increasingly contested. They require a capacity to "meet the
machine" and a poetics capable of new emendations.

In drawing this schematic history of contemporary textuality, it is my hope to
have convinced the reader of the very literal sense of depth manufactured into
the structure of commonplace modern-day literary devices that facilitate
reading and writing. Even print materials, which seem to escape computational
complexity, still follow the path of the fissure I have described above. With
a few exceptions, every transmitted sign today recapitulates the history of a
simulated semiotics. All printed media passes from keyboard to digital
storage, where it recedes from view. Finally, it emerges on the screen, in a
simulation that recreates some of the physical affordances lost in the process
of remediation. The reader turns an non-page, for there are no more pages to
be turned.

In its advanced form, the simulation usurps the simulated. The avatar
continues to mimic its object even as the object passes from use. Actions like
"scrolling" text on the screen simulate an action that for most users has no
basis in experience (of handling scrolls). The page too may at some point
cease to identify a material unit of information for a generation of readers
who have never seen paper pages---recall the viral image of a child trying to
"swipe" a magazine cover. Still, it is likely that the word processor and the
electronic book reader will continue to simulate digital pages. No longer
connected to any familiar physical affordances like scrolling, turing a page
will pass into the realm of a dead metaphor.

The gap between input and output is what gives rise to the ephemeral quality
of digital text. Temporary storage media located on the way from keyboard to
page or screen allows for rapid and frequent remediation. It keeps the ink in
motion unattached to a "sticky" medium like paper. However, the spatial
elongation of the sign also comes at a cost. Submerged in the passage between
keyboard and screen or paper, the inscription passes from view. In its
ephemeral "liquid" form it is also no longer legible to the naked human eye.
It reappears again on the screen or page already "processed," that is, altered
by the intervention of the "control unit." Writing or reading on a device can
thus no longer remain a solitary activity. Machine operators far removed from
the site of interpretation intervene to mediate the encounter between reader,
writer, and text.

The consequences of that intervention are immense. With time, supplemental
"control characters" designed to format documents fuse with programming
languages, capable of generalized device control. Technological and legal
fictions rise to restore a measure of "stickiness" to text in its ephemeral
form. For example, manufacturers commonly embed digital rights management
circuits into video streaming devices to artificially limit the duplication of
broadcast material. Similarly, electronic book sellers often prevent readers
from copying and pasting words on the page. Such measures mimic some of the
constraints associated with static, paper-and-ink-bound media regimes.

I began the book by asking: Where does the computed sign reside? The
complexity of the answer belies our alienation. Not since the pre-modern times
have readers and writers been so removed from the material contexts of
literacy.  The average reader today is privy only to the surface phenomena. To
rectify the situation is to acknowledge that all strategies of interpretation
from simple reading to literary analysis continue to rely on semiotic models
removed from the stark realities of the computed sign. The development of key
textual technologies that really do govern "intellect augmentation" *en masse*
happens in virtual isolation from the communities of practice. The condition
presents a grave danger to communities whose norms and practices rely on the
free flow of information between their members. Whatever the political goals,
humanists must work with software engineers and user interface designers to
engage in the grand project of augmenting the intelligence of humanity. We
must become our own bootstrapping community, capable of affecting the means of
our own intellectual production.

What seems like a given, necessary, and *a priori* configuration of writing
and reading implements---the keyboard, the hard drive, and the screen---is in
essence an ad-hoc, historically contingent, and ultimately permeable system of
information exchange. But to recover the sign in full we must enact a media
archaeology at all layers and sites of the inscription.

I am tempted to believe in conclusion, like others have before me, that I am
on my way to enacting something like "machine phenomenology" or "systems
phenomenology"---a glimpse within, into an inner space of an assemblage which
encompasses people, texts, techniques, and technologies. In such cases, astute
readers often reach for Jakob von Uexküll's *A Foray into the Worlds of
Animals and Humans* in order to borrow from his notion of perceptual worlds
(umwelten).[^ln3-umwelten] In his forays, Uexküll imagines a multitude of
alien ways of seeing the world, from that of a sea urchin to those of a pea
weevil and the ichneumon wasp. For Uexküll, the task of the biologist is not
to encounter such living things as unfamiliar "machines" in the human world,
but, rather, to occupy the alien life form as another subject. The tick should
not be looked at as yet another machine, Uexküll writes, but as an "operator"
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 44-53]. Consequent to this point of view is Uexküll's
insistence on the subjectivity of perceptual experience. The tick carries with
it its own sense of time and space, which the biologist recovers through the
description of its perceptual apparatus (What can this organism perceive?) and
therefore by reconstructing its projected world view (What does a stimulus
mean for this organism?). In this way, the subject establishes what Uexküll
calls a "circuit of meaning." The canopy of an oak tree, for example, acts in
unison with material properties of rain to capture and distribute liquid down
to the roots of the tree. Capturing and distributing liquid to the roots
constitutes, in that sense, the "meaning" of the oak--rain circuit. It is a
peculiar notion of "meaning" to be sure, but for Uexküll it is enough to
maintain that meaning arises out of the subject's interaction with its
environment. The subject and object are brought into what Uexküll calls
harmony:

```
    If the flower were not bee-like
    If the bee were not flower-like
    The harmony would never succeed [@uexkull_foray_2010, 198].
```

Similarly, the pea and the pea weevil achieve harmony through "meaning
transfer" between the pea and the weevil larvae, which allows the larvae to
prepare an escape hatch through vegetative matter in advance of its pupation
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 161].

[^ln3-umwelten]: See for example @agamben_open:_2003, 39-49; @hayles_print_2004,
16-17.

The literature of post-humanism privileges these moments of alien subjectivity
because they destabilize an anthropocentric view of the world. What gets lost
in the shifting of perspectives is the apparent contradiction at the very core
of what the writer Dorion Sagan calls "Gaia science" [@uexkull_foray_2010, 12],
the idea ascendant in diverse fields from literary studies to information
theory and free-market economics, relegating meaning creation from the level of
the subject to the level of complex system. Paradoxically, because Uexküll's
model of communication makes meaning available only at the system level ("oak
plus rain" or "bee plus flower"), it is never available to the subject itself
(bees or flowers). The quest for alien semiotics leads to, in Uexküll's own
words, "mute" interaction<!--note, full phrase "mute interaction" only in
intro, p 28. PRP-->[@uexkull_foray_2010, 148], meaningful only from some
vantage point outside of the system. The forest always "understands" more than
the tree, the planet more than the forest, and so on, in a regression that can
only conclude with whole-universe monism: the One.

In his essay on the subjective experience of bats, Thomas Nagel concludes that
there must be something about the experience of a bat *for* a bat
[@nagel_what_1974, 439] that is not fully accessible to human description. The
attempt to describe things in-themselves for-themselves, in that light, seems
like yet further human hubris. Accepting the meta-human "systems" view of
meaning formation would mean also to acknowledge the limits of the human to
comment on the proceedings---lest the organ speak for the organism. And to
encounter the bat (a dog, a tree, a machine) from the perspective of the human
is to respect and to retain a measure of the other's ineffable alienness. There
is a quiet humanism in Nagel's suggestion that we should confine our remarks to
objective phenomenology, not dependent on the self-deceiving acts of the
imagination [@nagel_what_1974, 449]. After all, one can never truly become a
bat or a tick.  We can only imagine what it is like to be a bat *for* a human.
"Certainly it *appears* unlikely," Nagel writes, "that we will get closer to the
real nature of human experience by leaving behind the particularity of our
human point of view and striving for a description in terms accessible to
beings that could not imagine what it was like to be us" [@nagel_what_1974,
444]. Nagel suggests: "Though presumably it would not capture
everything, its goal would be to describe, at least in part, the subjective
character of experiences in a form comprehensible to beings incapable of having
those experiences" [@nagel_what_1974, 449].

I do not know what a truly objective phenomenology would look like, but I would
like to think that it would lie, at least in part, in the underlying material
conditions of perceptual media. I am able to advance an equitable description
of the system from the only perspective available to me. These blueprints and
diagrams are all we have to understand the ways in which the system affects its
constituents. Paying attention to the details of the schematics is the only way
to "dig" ourselves into something like an alien phenomenology. As the
humanities move in search of the digital, I find that they need to regain
a sense of the human. No perspective is available otherwise from which to enact
analysis or critique. Once recovered, that Archimedean point of leverage can
serve as a starting point for the work of de-naturalizing comfortable (if
calcified) notions of the digital. It is in this de-familiarization (in a sense
used by Viktor Shklovsky and Svetlana Boym) of the human that I see Uexküll's
contribution to the study of media phenomenology. The human disappears from
view not by some inevitable property of technological progress, but through
automation of experience. In refracting ourselves through the gaze of the
technological other we see the human world anew.

I return, then, to the subject of time, found throughout in the background of
this book. The popular imagination of digital machines belies a deep sense of
anxiety about the rhythm of the system as a whole, in which humans play only
a small part (as bug operators, users, or receivers). Telegraphs and
subsequently computers force an atomization of experience into discrete bits,
along with the opposite movement toward continuity fluid and rapid enough as to
move beyond the boundaries of human perception. Attention to the material
conditions of removable storage media reveals a delicate negotiation of
synchronicity between human and machine time, in a complex chain of encoding
and re-mediation that connects differing and incongruent perceptual apparatus.
Under these conditions, it would be a mistake to conflate digital and discrete,
just as it would be a mistake to reduce the human to the continuous.
Homeostasis is found at some arbitrary point, contingently connected to human
biology and to current technological capability. The question of "What
constitutes a moment?" when watching television or reading a book, can become
then, "What *should* constitute a moment?" For the tick lying in wait for its
next warm meal, a moment can last for decades (Uexküll reports up to 18 years).
"Time, which frames all events," Uexküll writes, "seemed to us to be the only
objectively consistent factor, […] but now we see that the subject controls the
time of its environment" [@uexkull_foray_2010, 52]. The computational
environment before us constitutes the grounds for all higher-level interpretive
activity---from reading poetry to debugging code or diagnosing a patient. From
the textual grounds of human-machine interaction it then becomes possible to
derive a poetics, in the sense of a study and an art of creating one's own
time: prosody, meter, harmony, cadence, and syncopation.
