# Conclusion: Human Grounds for Computation

As I write, a receiver of a pacemaker implant fights for her right to access
its software. "What code," she wants to know, "is running inside my body"
[@mcgowan_i_2016]. In Pakistan, the American National Security
agency-sponsored Skynet program has placed people on the US-sanctioned
"disposition matrix" or "kill list" based on predictive analytics: social
network analysis, cellular machine learning, patterns of travel and telephone
use. Automated tools with names like SMARTTRACKER, SMARTCHART, and Cloud
Travel Analytic select people for target strikes by unmanned areal vehicles
[@mcneal_targeted_2014; @weber_keep_2016]. Willingly, or not, we are engaged
in a political struggle to control and deploy such codified resources. The
heart and the sky are sites on which the tactics of inscription are
increasingly contested. They require a capacity to "meet the machine" and a
poetics capable of new emendations.

The history of digital text points to a real sense of depth manufactured into
the mechanisms of everyday literary devices. With a few exceptions, every
transmitted sign today recapitulates the history of a simulated semiotics.
Even print, which seems to escape computational complexity, still follows the
path of electronic fissure. All inscription passes from keyboard to storage,
where it recedes from view. It emerges on the screen, finally, with a
simulation the physical affordances that it lost in remediation. The reader
turns an non-page, for there are no more pages to be turned.

In its advanced form, the simulation usurps the simulated. The avatar
continues to mimic its object even as the object passes from use. "Scrolling
text," for example, has no basis in our experience of handling scrolls. The
page may go the same way. Readers who have never seen paper pages---recall the
viral image of a child trying to "swipe" a magazine cover---will cease to
identify it with a  material unit of information. But like the scrolling of
scrolls, word processors and e-books will likely continue to simulate digital
pages. No longer connected to any familiar physical affordances turing pages
will pass into the realm of dead metaphor.

The gap between input and output is what makes digital texts ephemeral.
Temporary storage media, located between keyboard and screen, allow for rapid
remediation. They keep ink in motion, across surfaces, unattached to "sticky"
media like paper. Such spatial elongation comes at a cost: the inscription
passes from view. The sign reappears again on screen, already "processed,"
that is, altered by the intervention of the "control unit." Literacy is no
longer solitary. Machine operators far removed from the site of interpretation
intervene between readers, writers, and texts.

The consequences of intervention are immense. Supplemental "control
characters," originally used for formatting, have fused with programming
languages and become capable of generalized remote control. Technological and
legal fictions rise to restore a measure of "stickiness" to ephemeral text.
Digital rights management circuits, for example, are embedded into video
streaming devices to artificially limit the duplication of broadcast material.
Similarly, electronic book sellers prevent readers from copying and pasting
words. Such measures mimic the constraints associated with static,
paper-and-ink-bound media regimes.

I began this book by asking: Where does the computed sign reside? The
complexity of my answer belies our alienation. Not since pre-modern times have
we been so removed from the material contexts of knowledge production. The
average reader today is privy only to surface phenomena. To meet the machine
we must base our strategies of interpretation, from simple reading to literary
analysis, on newly emergent, computational realities. Technologies that govern
literacy should not develop in isolation from the humanities. Such isolation
is dangerous for communities that rely on the free flow of information.
Whatever their political goals, humanists must work with software engineers to
engage in the grand project of augmenting our collective intelligence. Only
then we become a bootstrapping community.

What seems like a given, necessary, and *a priori* configuration of writing
and reading implements---keyboard, hard drive, screen---is, in essence, an
ad-hoc, historically contingent, and ultimately permeable system of
information exchange. To recover the sign in full we will have to conduct
media archaeology at all layers and sites of inscription.

I am tempted to believe, like others before me, that I am enacting something
like "machine phenomenology"---a glimpse within, into an assemblage of people,
texts, techniques, and technologies. In such cases, astute readers often reach
for Jakob von Uexküll's *A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans* to
borrow his notion of perceptual worlds [*umwelten*].[^ln3-umwelten] In his
forays, Uexküll sees our world from many alien perspectives: that of a sea
urchin, a pea weevil, and the ichneumon wasp. The biologist's task, Uexküll
believes, is not to encounter such living things as unfamiliar "machines,"
but, rather, to occupy their alien life forms. The tick should not be looked
at as yet another machine, Uexküll writes, but as an "operator"
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 44-53]. Consequently, he insists on the subjectivity of
perceptual experience. The tick carries with it its own sense of time and
space, which the biologist recovers through a description of its perceptual
apparatus.

The canopy of an oak, for example, acts in unison with rain to capture and
distribute liquid down its roots. Capturing and distributing liquid to the
roots constitutes, in that sense, the "meaning" of the oak--rain circuit. It
is a peculiar notion of "meaning" to be sure, but for Uexküll it is enough to
conclude that meaning arises from a subject's interaction with its
environment. A "circuit of meaning" is thereby created between the organism
and its surroundings. The subject and object are brought into harmony:

> If the flower were not bee-like
> If the bee were not flower-like
> The harmony would never succeed [@uexkull_foray_2010, 198].

Post-humanism privileges moments of such alien signification because they
destabilize an anthropocentric worldview. What gets lost in the shift of
perspectives is the apparent contradiction at the very core of what Dorion
Sagan has called the "Gaia sciences" [@uexkull_foray_2010, 12], the idea
ascendant in diverse fields from literary studies to information theory and
free-market economics, relegating meaning creation from the level of the
subject to the level of complex system.  Paradoxically, because Uexküll's
model of communication makes meaning available only at the system level ("oak
plus rain" or "bee plus flower"), it is never available to the subject itself
(bees or flowers). The quest for alien semiotics leads to, in Uexküll's own
words, "mute interaction" [@uexkull_foray_2010, 148], meaningful only from
some vantage point outside of the system. The forest always "understands" more
than the tree, the planet more than the forest, and so on, in a regression
that can only conclude with whole-universe monism: the One.

In his essay on the subjective experience of bats, Thomas Nagel concludes that
there must be something about the experience of a bat *for* a bat
[@nagel_what_1974, 439] that is not fully accessible to human description. The
attempt to describe things in-themselves for-themselves, in that light, seems
like yet further human hubris. Accepting the meta-human "systems" view of
meaning formation would mean also to acknowledge the limits of the human to
comment on the proceedings---lest the organ speak for the organism. And to
encounter the bat (a dog, a tree, a machine) from the perspective of the human
is to respect and to retain a measure of the other's ineffable alienness. There
is a quiet humanism in Nagel's suggestion that we should confine our remarks to
objective phenomenology, not dependent on the self-deceiving acts of the
imagination [@nagel_what_1974, 449]. After all, one can never truly become a
bat or a tick.  We can only imagine what it is like to be a bat *for* a human.
"Certainly it appears unlikely," Nagel writes, "that we will get closer to the
real nature of human experience by leaving behind the particularity of our
human point of view and striving for a description in terms accessible to
beings that could not imagine what it was like to be us" [@nagel_what_1974,
444]. Nagel suggests: "Though presumably it would not capture
everything, its goal would be to describe, at least in part, the subjective
character of experiences in a form comprehensible to beings incapable of having
those experiences" [@nagel_what_1974, 449].

I do not know what a truly objective phenomenology would look like, but I would
like to think that it would lie, at least in part, in the underlying material
conditions of perceptual media. I am able to advance an equitable description
of the system from the only perspective available to me. These blueprints and
diagrams are all we have to understand the ways in which the system affects its
constituents. Paying attention to the details of the schematics is the only way
to "dig" ourselves into something like an alien phenomenology. As the
humanities move in search of the digital, I find that they need to regain a
sense of the human. No perspective is available otherwise from which to enact
analysis or critique. Once recovered, that Archimedean point of leverage can
serve as a starting point for the work of de-naturalizing comfortable (if
calcified) notions of the digital. It is in this de-familiarization (in a sense
used by Viktor Shklovsky and Svetlana Boym) of the human that I see Uexküll's
contribution to the study of media phenomenology. The human disappears from
view not by some inevitable property of technological progress, but through
automation of experience. In refracting ourselves through the gaze of the
technological other we see the human world anew.

I return, then, to the subject of time, found throughout in the background of
this book. The popular imagination of digital machines belies a deep sense of
anxiety about the rhythm of the system as a whole, in which humans play only a
small part (as bug operators, users, or receivers). Telegraphs and
subsequently computers force an atomization of experience into discrete bits,
along with the opposite movement toward continuity fluid and rapid enough as
to move beyond the boundaries of human perception. Attention to the material
conditions of removable storage media reveals a delicate negotiation of
synchronicity between human and machine time, in a complex chain of encoding
and re-mediation that connects differing and incongruent perceptual apparatus.
Under these conditions, it would be a mistake to conflate digital and
discrete, just as it would be a mistake to reduce the human to the
continuous.[^ln3-cont] Homeostasis is found at some arbitrary point,
contingently connected to human biology and to current technological
capability. The question of "What constitutes a moment?" when watching
television or reading a book, can become then, "What *should* constitute a
moment?" For the tick lying in wait for its next warm meal, a moment can last
for decades (Uexküll reports up to 18 years). "Time, which frames all events,"
Uexküll writes, "seemed to us to be the only objectively consistent factor
[…], but now we see that the subject controls the time of its environment"
[@uexkull_foray_2010, 52]. The computational environment before us constitutes
the grounds for all higher-level interpretive activity---from reading poetry
to debugging code or diagnosing a patient. From the textual grounds of
human-machine interaction it then becomes possible to derive a poetics, in the
sense of a study and an art of creating one's own time: prosody, meter,
harmony, cadence, and syncopation.
