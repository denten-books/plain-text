# Introduction

## Thesis, Audience
Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. A fundamental concept in the development of computing, plain text stands in opposition to closed platforms, rarefied knowledge, and black-box devices. Instead, it offers a vision of data that is human-readable by design: portable, concise, and universal. This book contains an argument for plain text, seeking to empower a community of students, scholars, authors, publishers, librarians, activists, and, generally, citizens interested in re-evaluating some of the ideas, tools, and practices that shape their daily encounter with computation.

The argument starts with foundational principles of media and literary studies and information science. I ask: what is at stake in the difference between digital and analog?  What contains more information a block of wood or a novel? How is text structured? What separates meaning, form, and formatting? Where does data end and meta-data begin? What does it mean to "have read a book" or to "know something"? To what extent is media the message? The formulation of these broadly philosophic concerns influences the more pragmatically-minded and applied discussion in the second half of the book. Thinking together about the nature of human-computer interfaces, knowledge as hardware and software, links, networking, inter-textuality, word processing, text encoding, and cryptography will allow us to approach issues of control and governance, access and cooperation, consensus and dissent, and privacy and surveillance.

A secondary aim of this volume is to convince the reader, especially one without much technical background, to view their computational environment as a literary system. I mean a "literary system" in opposition to what one might conventionally mistake for a "binary" or "digital" one, however imprecise those terms are in everyday use. And should I succeed, I ask the readers to apply the same critical acuity to reading code as they do to close-reading of prose and poetry. Admittedly, to treat computers as a literary system is an unusual proposition, but one that I hope to sustain on a firm basis, grounded in literary theory and in the history of modern computing. Detailed case studies from that history will point to (what I hope is an) unexpected confluence between the shared history of computing and literary thought. 

A parallel audience to the one composed of non-technical readers is one that shares expertise in computer science or electrical engineering, but also one that does not usually view its daily practice in its historical, philosophical, and political contexts. Designers, software engineers, system administrators, and project managers are often asked to make choices at work that have not only technological, but broader social and cultural implications. Choosing a text editor, a filing system, or a social networking platform cannot be adequately addressed in shallow instrumental terms like efficacy, speed, or performance. Such choices also affect deep structures of knowledge transmission, the formation of collective and institutional memories, the quality of online discussion, and the ways in which we relate to our family, friends, and colleagues. Ultimately, in the concluding chapters, this book is meant to challenge the widely-held (if often hidden) notion that systems can give rise to ethical or political values. Values, as I will argue, must be projected from without, by free-willing agents that can voluntarily deliberate, form consensus, and  articulate shared goals. The only sentient beings answering to these criteria are humans (and not, for example, cyborgs or complex systems). The book then is ultimately an articulation of a new humanism, which runs counter to the recent theoretical turn towards post- and trans- humanisms which elevate systems (natural and artificial) to the privileged position of ethical and political agents. 

## Format
The book is a book, but also a tool. Readers will get much more out of it if they are able to actively follow along using their terminal emulator of choice. If these words mean nothing to you, rest assured that the text assumes no prior technical knowledge. It can be read sequentially as a conventional piece of scholarship in textual theory or "new media" studies. For those willing to take the plunge, I will often illustrate abstract theoretical concepts by asking the reader to type some commands into their terminals. Detailed instructions on how to set up this "augmented" reading environment, tutorials, and explanations can be found in the technical appendix and on the forthcoming companion website. 

Both novices and experts alike can benefit from exposure to ideas in the command line, on the level of the operating system. At the very least, the reader will walk way from this book with concepts and skills foundational to computing as critical thought and critical practice. But I hope that many readers will go beyond the basics, gaining deep-seated, intuitive, "hands-on" understanding of operational concepts like files, filing systems, networks, search tools, servers, and encryption technologies. Developing an intuitive understanding of systems that structure so much of our daily activity has the potential to radically transform one's experience with text, media, and digital devices. 

## Theory, Method

### Pragmatism
Unmoored theoretical concepts like "text" and "media" gain a palpable form when explored in the context of their instantiation. This is both model and method structuring the inquiry advanced here. Allow me to spend the next few paragraphs in laying bare the reasoning and the history behind this approach to the study technology, texts, and people.

The idea that "meaning" is always in some sense "operational meaning" is a proposition implicit in several related philosophical traditions. The first of these is pragmatism, broadly conceived. William James articulates that view when he writes that "reality is seen to be grounded in a perfect jungle of concrete expediencies [@james-pragmatism-conceptionoftruth]." For James (and, to some extent, for his fellow travellers in American pragmatism, Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey)[^ln-pragma-truth] the pragmatic answer to the question of truth could be reduced to the questions efficient causes and effects. In his essay "Pragmatism's Conception of Truth," James asks: "How will the truth be realized What concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life? What experiences will be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false?"

[^ln-pragma-truth]: For a more thorough discussion on the topic see @seigfried, @pihlström, and @putnam-james-theory. 

For this reason, theories of the shape "X is" (as in, "the author is dead" or "art is transcendent") beg the questions of "Where?," "When?," "For Whom?," and "What's at stake in maintaining that?"

Following James and Ramsey's pragmatic insight, I will maintain throughout that abstract categories like "text" and "media" cannot possibly be (although they often are) reduced to a number of essential, structural features. Rather, to borrow from a conversation on categories in Wittgenstein's *Philosophic Investigations*, categories denote a related "family" of practices, which may or may not share in any given familial characteristic [@Wittgestein-philo-invest]. Imagine a Venn diagram, where fields of textuality intersect and diverge in a historically (culturally, practically) contingent, arbitrary ways. These fields lie in relation to specific communities of practice, which often do not in themselves employ a controlled taxonomy. What counts for "code" and "poetry" can change from day to day for communities of coders and poets. It may even change for a single individual who writes code by day and poetry by night, employing operational vocabularies in changing and perhaps even contradicting ways as they shift contexts.

Discourse Analysis, STS and Kuhn, Model-dependent realism.

Frank Ramsey (a close friend and colleague of Wittgenstein), who would write that meaning "is to be defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would lead [@ramsey-foundationsofmath p.155]."[@goodman-wittandjames] 

In this way, my own definitions of key operational concepts in the field of literary and media theory hinge on a pragmatic consideration of causes and effects. Throughout, in discussing operational definitions of concepts like "text" and "media," I am compelled to insist on the question: "What is at stake in defining it that way?"

It is one thing, for example, to theorize about form and content, and it is quite another to see how form and content are encoded in .txt and .pdf formats and to further how these distinctions then affect material divisions of labor between "knowledge workers," "content producers," typesetting sweatshops, and international conglomerates that control vectors of literary distribution.

### Materialism
Marxism, media archeology, pam smith.
The logic of pragmatic theory naturally suggests materialism. Why? 

In viewing text as merely surface phenomenon, we are in danger of misapprehending deep structures that . A critic could (Email as intertext seems rhizomatic and decentralized. But, yet at the layer of infrastructure (routers, switches, service providers) it is highly hierarchical. Understanding that underlying structure of information helps us expose the flows of power and control. We can understand how censorship happens. Or surveillance. 

A corrective to Marxist materialism that views materialism as representation of such. Superstratum and substratum. Surface and depth. A corrective to Marxism. Publishing is broken @kfitzpatrick.

That is not to suggest that depth. Respond to @marcus.

Media archeology. Actual archeology though. Unix operating systems that run everything from super computers, televisions, and mobile phones. Excavating text through the kernel. Discovering latent tools, practices, and forms of textuality still extent on the device.

The methodological move from theory, to history, into practice follows a recent interest in the fields of philosophy, history, and literary studies in supplementing thought with a robust sense of doing and making. My own version of is embodied in the idea of "experimental methods." What does it mean to “experiment” in the study of history, literature, or philosophy? In answering that question I draw inspiration from two distinct spaces. First, the laboratory, where scientists bracket the world in search for independent variables and reproducible results. Second, the studio, where artists let the world in: to disrupt rigid modes of perception under circumstances that are always indeterminate and subjective [@cage]. In both spaces, thought is secreted in practice, “on the fetid and throbbing ground of life [@bernard].”[^ln-xpmeth] 

[^ln-xpmeth]: I've quoted this formulation in the mission statement of xpmeth.github.io website 
[^ln-cage]: "Here the word 'experimental' is apt, providing it is understood not as describing an act to be later judged in terms of success and failure, but simply as of an act the outcome of which is unknown." John Cage as quoted in Nyman, Michael (1974). Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond. Cambridge, UK.

Making and knowing. How does this work for texts? Restate thesis. 


## Market & Reach

Media Studies, STS, Philosophy of Technology 
Affinities to science and technology studies, new media studies, platform studies, critical code studies, media archeology, computational culture studies. A group of media theorists discussing photography in the last few decades fail to grasp some fundamental truths about the medium divorced from the mechanics of CMOS censors, optics, and from the practice of editing images digitally in Photoshop. A conversation divorced from the material stratum of images and from the practice of photography is restricted to the surface image. It can deal only with the relationship of pixels on the screen (or dots on a page). In response to this line of critique, media studies as a field has been undergoing a practical turn from surface to materiality in practice Similar books.
My approach to media theory attempts to make good on the promise. Where I often begin with philosophical 
Only in this way can media studies answer the lofty goals of critique. There is no hope of reaching from the screen to the political consequences without grounding analysis in practice. A critique in tradition of the Frankfurt school, requires further understanding of the economic reality of media, its legal and legislative context, issues of intellectual property and labor conditions. 

Digital Humanities.
Brings it closer to digital humanities, which is very material but often atheoretical. Theory in material and practice. Similar books. @kirshenbaum

Human-computer interaction. Knowledge workers, architects, and designers.
For CS folk, grounds practice in a theoretical discussion that attracts a wider audience to computing fundamentals. Confusion due to technical literacy. Books like "visual thinking," but many interfaces are still heavily textual (email, blog, etc).

But it is all really literary theory, textual scholarship, philology. Kernighan, Julia Hershberg. Elaine Scarry, Bill Todd. Bruce Robbins and Jean Howard. Brian Larkin and Alexander Galloway. DH: Ray Siemens
The key terms are important a in a range of fields. Expanding literary studies. motivate me: information, digital, data. OS as a type of literature, but not reduced to text. Text as far as the concept of text is explicitly "baked into" the system. A close reading of code and system architecture.
Media archeology: textual archeology. Computers containing vestiges of ideas and direction. Can be done in situ. Applied turn in media studies. Confusion due to technical literacy. Forms of latent textuality still extant. Berkman center. Reaching out.

Something like a textbook in "applied media studies" or "theoretical digital humanities."
I teach widely around the country (DHSI, Lede, NYU) and I use these materials myself. I can see a course structured around these skills and ideas. 




## Chapter Outlines
I tend to write concisely--a style that I think fits well with the subject matter, and something that should appeal to the audience. At this point, I am aiming for a manuscript of around 60-80k words, which would allot around 5-7k words per chapter (around 20-30 book pages).

### Chapter 1: We Have Always Been Digital
Digital. Analog. Soap opera effect. 
### Chapter 2: Freedom of Information
The "systems" definition of information. Shannon and Weaver. Argue for the freedom of the sender and receiver instead of the system.
### Chapter 3: Text, Form, Formating
Text as meaning, semantics structure, and style. 
### Chapter 4: Scratch Collector
Data and metadata.
### Chapter 5: Media, Message, Mode
### Chapter 6: Platforms of Self
### Chapter 7: Textual Interfaces
### Chapter 8: Hardware, Software, and the Platonic Forms
### Chapter 9: Bad Links
### Chapter 10: Processing Words
### Chapter 11: Code and Crypt
### Chapter 12: New Humanism
### Tech Appendix

## Timeline
I keep detailed logs of my daily writing practice. During the academic year, I average around 250 words per day, a number that nearly triples during breaks. Assuming a manuscript of around 80k words (and discounting the fact that large poritions of this book are anicipated in my dissertation), a conservative estimate of my schedule would place the final draft somwhere towards the second half of ther summer, 2015. 

# Part I

## We Have Always Been Digital
Key terms: binary, digital, analog, plain text, surface, depth
Commands: pwd, ls, cd, cat, wc

In an ASCII-rendered plain text file, byte count corresponds to character count.[^ln-char] Let these words soak in for a moment. The rest of the book will be spent unpacking this idea. We will have to come to terms with what "plain text," "ASCII," and "bytes" really represent. But for now, a common-sense understanding of the sentiment will suffice. It is enough to have the intuition that texts and characters are concepts meant for humans and that bytes have something to do with (and for) machines. Remarkably, under the singular conditions of plain text (and even then, not always, and with many caveats), a unit of information meaningful to me (a human for the most part) gains a measure of equivalence to a byte, a unit of information meant for a computer (which is, however likable, still a machine).

[^ln-char]: There are many caveats here, to be explored later. Follow along with excercises related to the discussion in the Technical Appendix.

Recent theory challenges the conceptual boundaries between humans and machines in a concerted way. Perhaps, such boundaries were never that clearly articulated in the first place. It is also likely that other modalities of being are possible on the spectrum between human and machine, or human and complex system. We will have a chance to explore these possibilities in Part II of the book. For now, I ask that the reader simply rely on the colloquial, pre-theoretical understanding of both person and instrument. However intertwined the hand and the hammer can be, there is a way in which even a child can separate one from the other. There is a deep-rooted instinct at work in that distinction, one that cannot and should not be dismissed as mere naivete. The concept of a human is in itself a powerful theoretical construct, and, as I will argue later, one necessary, not only for the understanding of key concepts in computer science, but also in articulating an ethics and a politics of computation.

But before we can get there, we need to gain clarity on the key terms of the conversation. Too often anxiety about algorithmic thinking, data, and digitization is fueled by simplistic and downright misguided ideas about the underlying technologies. Part I of this book is dedicated to building a critical vocabulary that goes hand-in-hand with digital literacy. Those with an engineering background will be introduced to an intellectual history of ideas that guide practice. And those readers interested in "theory," will gain a measure of technical competency required for higher-level thinking (opinion-formation and decision-making) about the subject.

Digitality is first in a long series of these muddled terms. The original intuition, challenged by Nelson Goodman in the late sixties, still holds sway in the popular imagination. On this view, digitality has relates to digits, just as "analog" relates to analogies. First use of the word digital. The distinction between analog and metaphysical threat, Kittler and Golumbia. 

Language is digital. Soap opera effect. Gaps that allow the brain to fill it. Striation. Preserving striation. History of UTF8. Unix philosophy. 

Binary tends towards the continuoius (get the ch. Reality TV and the soap opera effect. Digitality is something worthy of being preserved.

### Text Plain and Fancy 

## Freedom of Information
Information is intentional. Against the "cybernatic" formal definitions. 

Information as entropy. The strangeness of Weaver's "information as entropy". How much information in a brick? In a novel? Information as a possibility.

Freedom and information seem to have nothing to do with each other. They have everything to do with each other.
Makukov. Directed pan-spermia.Life Sciences in Space Research paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5618 Icarus paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6739 

What is information? The difference that makes a difference. Bateson's definition. Dorsality. Weaver's entropy. Explain. Amount of freedom. Confusion in that paper. Noise and information seem to be the same! Thermodynamic explaination. Transmitting things in stone (low entropy) vs. transmitting them through the air (high entropy). Does a block of wood have more "information" than a novel? This definition cannot account for it really.

Extended cognition hypothesis. Get this text from disertation. The monism problem.

Formal vs. instrumental definitions. Information is that which moves form a Mind > Encoding > Mediation > Decoding > Transmision. Coersion. Can information be coersed? Both on the sending and the recieving end. Can someone admit something is music by force? Can you force information. The deer and the tick. The deer does not "send" bodyheat information. The tick receives information as it does receive the action of gravity. Does a mountain erode from the top because it recieves information from the outside? Information here is simply used as a synonym for some material state of the univrse and the causal relationship between forces. Causality alone is not information. Laws of physics are not information. Well, unless...

Mis information. Man in the middle attacks. Information is intentional. Mind to mind communication. Where does the thought originate? Freedom. Free intent. Identity of coding and decoding is not necessery. What is however necessary is the

## Text, Form, Formatting
POSIX. Form. Style. Content.
What is and what is not information. From abstract to specific. Material substratum.
UTF History. Unix ideas of plain text.
Traditional distinction: Jacobson. Semantic, Stylistic, Content. Surface Depth.

Version control, drafts, versioning. What is a text?

Wikipedia as a Turing complete language. The power of versioning. Text as a vector. The problem of annotation. What are we annotating? Annotation solutions force a platform. Is Hamlet a platonic object? A family of related objects? Standard English editions in Europe.
## Scratch Collector
Data, Metadata
Code and comments. Collector of chair or collector of scratches. Object oriented ontology. Object oriented languages. Competing paradigms: separation of code and data. No separation (Haskell).

## Media, Message, Mode
Key terms: media, message, mode

What happens in the change from speaking to writing? The violin (copy from dissertation here).

Attunement of listener. Message stays the same. Put a ear, eye, hand to the pipe. Same message, same medium, different mode.

Krap's Last tape here. 
Who are you communicating with? Pushing yourself through the pipe. The appointment with myself. The sum-total of material substratum. Building a wider platform. Todo, email, diary, music collection. Burning building-we grab our memories, and hoarding the disfunction of that personal sediment. You are the sum-total of your modalities. Commitments to self. Attunement of self. The message is you. Preserving ourself from entropy. 

Books are not media they are platforms. Platform is all of the above. Plus the economic / cultural contexts. Amazon Kindle is a platform. Who are you communicating with? Yoursef. What is the message. Ultimtely, it is a message of self-identity. 

## Filing System, Platform of Self
Key terms: file, document, stream, net neutrality
Commands: grep, awk, sed 

Documents as vectors. Not completed things. Files as cognitive scaffolding for collective memory. Vissman. 

Science lecture vs. humanities. Stuff that is known. Stuff that is not known

What does it really mean to "know" something? Or to have "read" a book? I have had the following conversation countless times. Someone asks, "Have you read Nabokov's *Pale Fire*," and I respond, "Yes I have." But there is a world of a difference between reading it yesterday, last week, or ten years ago. The book as an interface leaves an organic trace in the human mind--an imprint that begins to fade as soon as it is created.

How much knowledge is there in the world? According to a recent paper published in Science, 295 exabytes (or billion gigabytes).[@hilbert] 

Whatever consciousness is, it is propelled forward on a thin edge of material substratum. Reality exists only in the now, where the past is a memory and the future only a possibility. Imagine whispering something to a friend. It does not have to be very complicated, something like "I love you" or "I miss you." The whisper dissipates as soon it is uttered. The percussion of the speaker's breath creates temporary order: giving shape and pushing air molecules into waves of pattern and form. That order begins dissipating as soon as it is created. Within milliseconds, molecules return to their natural state of chaos.

To steel ourselves against entropy, we change the substratum from air to stone. It's molecules are more stable. Etched in stone will be the same message. It will last longer now. But it will also take longer to create. You will have to carry around your tablet and chisel. The message etched in stone will outlive the whisper and indeed will

Repercussion?

The book as an interface between human and ?. We must see it in the context of interfaces.


# Part II

## Textual Interfaces
Containing an argument for text as an interface between human and machine. History of combinatorial languages and logic.  Stack as a model of communication

Talk about stack exchange vs. 4chan vs. reddit

Handwriting. Teaching children how to "write". Typing vs. handwriting.

## Hardware, Software and the Platonic Forms
One of my favorite "virtual" disagreements in print is between Kittler and Lev Manovich. "There is No Hardware" and "There is Only Software."

Turing's machine. Universalism vs. drucker. Bit, byte. State machines. The magic of boostrapping. Plato and Epicurus.

### Philosophical Foundations of Computing
The magic of hardware-software distinction. "Where the Platonic rubber meets the road." Goodman and the problem of self-identity.

The dream of a universal language. Lully. Leibniz with digital and logic. Boole with boolean logic. Shannon with the insight that boolean logic can be implemented in circuits. Finally, Turing, with his Unversal Turing Machine. Answer the following questions here:  How does Turing define the state of the machine? What is the equivalent of a "program" or "software" in the language of the paper? What is the difference between a Turing machine and a universal Turing machine? How is the state of the machine similar to a "state of mind?" What is the difference between what we understand as "software," "hardware," and "data" in Turing's language?

"Claude Shannon first explicitly posed the question of finding the smallest possible universal Turing machine in 1956. He showed that two symbols were sufficient so long as enough states were used (or vice-versa), and that it was always possible to exchange states by symbols." Get at this. States and symbols.

"Where the Platonic rubber meets the road." Goodman and the problem of self-identity.


### The problem of duplicates
The conversation between Goodman and Genette. Goodman's "Art and Authenticity." Benjamin. Immanence and transcendence. Goodman: thinking about the perfect copy. But there is a confusion here: fake art is not necessarily about a copy, it is about provenance. Autographic vs. allographic art. Whether forgery is possible. Digital vs. analog art. Analog art is medium bound. Digital abstracts from the material.

## Bad Links, Intertextuality, Symbolic links
Rise of intertextuality. The promise of hypertext. Bush w/ Memex. Nelson. Failure of intertext. Borrow from bad links here.
It is my intention here to convince you that links are bad. They are bad when it comes to writing for the web in general, bad for books, bad for long-form journalism, and even worse in academic publication. It is not that I am against the idea of links. As we will see here, the problem lies in the way links are used. That is also to say that we can do something about using links better. But first, why are links so bad?

To start with, links are opaque. The worst of lot are links like this and this. Of the two “thises,” the first leads us to Google and the second to Bing. But your readers would not know that just by looking at the text. The best they can do is “hover” over the word with their mouse cursor, relying on the browser interface to show them where the link is going. And once they get there, there are no easy ways to get back. The writer must have faith in the browser to “do the right thing” in guiding the reader through an intertextual maze. And that is not right when it comes to writing. In most situations, the author should architect that experience explicitly. If you think about it, the old-fashioned apparatus of quoting an external text is itself a type of linking. But rather than quoting the whole text, the author only quotes the relevant bits. Sending readers away to do that work on their own is lazy and irresponsible. Imagine a tour guide who tells his tourists to “just go over there and look at some stuff,” and “come back when you’re done.” Links can be that disorienting.

Links disrupt the reading experience, and that is the second reason for why links are bad. It is possible that you want the reader’s experience to be disrupted. But in many cases you don’t. And the reader is already distracted by the proliferation of parallel windows and devices that augment their reading in some way. Do we need to make that distraction easier? Should I link the Wikipedia article on media multitasking or is it enough for my purposes to simply mention Wikipedia, or to trust my reader to look something up later, in a reference source of their own choosing? Or better yet, should I help the reader along by summarizing the findings? It mentions that most folks already read with a second screen in tow. It is not that unusual to see someone look something up on their phone or tablet while reading a newspaper or an e-book. Why? Because they don’t want to leave the flow of the first screen. There is great pleasure in immersive, uninterrupted reading.

Besides being disruptive, links are ugly. They are ugly together, as in when many links conspire to produce a tangled mess. And they are also ugly when naked on their own, like this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaGiFBG_WSEGKFey9sR0pafjjKK7Fuc0jhF5d4K1ouA/edit. That string of characters is not meant for human consumption! The period at the end kills me entirely. Meaningless punctuation inside of links coupled with regular punctuation ruins the sentence and the paragraph. Of course, I could just tell you to read something on Google Docs. That looks much better, but then we are making the opaqueness problem worse by hiding the address behind words that may or may not be related to the destination. It seems that we are stuck compromising on either transparency, reading flow, or visual impact.

Links aren’t very secure to begin with, but hiding links behind words further compromises security. You’ve probably heard of link-baiting: the purposefully malicious attempts to trick a reader into revealing personal information when following a link that masquerades as a legitimate destination. You can visit my site to learn more about link-baiting. You shouldn’t have clicked that! (Don’t worry, that was the real Google login page.) But even if one means well, viruses and browser exploits can inject bad links into your otherwise legitimate ones. A common technique is to install a browser script along with some seemingly useful “search bar” that will redirect all legitimate links to a site that makes money by advertising. Worse yet, you could end up on a site that attempts to further compromise your computer. Links are not secure because in linking, we outsource the relationship between reader and content to the browser.

Links are opaque, disruptive, ugly, unsafe, and they rot. Links don’t last because the content at the address is dynamic. It is not guaranteed to be there decades, months, minutes after your initial visit. In that case, why even bother? The link works best for ephemeral output (like a tweet). We must think of something much more robust for any “serious” writing that hopes to survive to the end of the week. And for the really good stuff, the kind of stuff that is the purview of librarians, we need to cultivate sustainable, long-lasting, responsible practices of online citation. It should work as well, if not better, than the familiar bibliographic citation in print. This practice should combat digital decay, not aid it. We need to think about the ways our links can be accessed, mined, and preserved with the archive-grade zeal of the rare book librarian.

Finally, links are terrible for accessibility. It is bad enough that clicking on a small word like this is difficult for people with any sort of fine-motor control problems. Being a little older in itself can make the online reading experience painful. Things are much worse for those with Parkinson’s or for the blind. Sina Bahram, a blind usability expert (who is himself blind) reports that some sites contain thousands (!) of links in advance of actual content. Screen readers for the blind must read each one of them out loud. For the screen reader, there is no difference between garbage links and useful content. If you thought looking at links is disruptive, imagine listening to a robotic voice that pronounces every slash and every useless number in: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92pM6hJG6Wo. And that is why Sina Bahram listens to his reader at 950 words per minute.

Any one of these issues alone should give us pause. Together, they are a cause of grave concern. How did we get here? And what can we do to make links good again?

How did we get here is not an easy question. A part of the story is surely the excitement we once felt about hypertext. Links were supposed to break the hegemony of linear narrative, ushering in a new interconnected world. To some extent the dream came true. But links also brought with them such things as Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Google’s PageRank algorithm tracks, among other things, the number of incoming and outgoing links. This bias for connectivity encourages “link farms”: sites that attempt to game the system by aggregating links or cross-linking their own content. A sure sign of a vacuous SEO-driven piece of writing is a certain cynical and strategic use of links to other popular sources. How long until the SEO logic infects poetry, fiction, or investigative journalism?

What can we do to make links better? There are a few things we all can do now. First, let’s use links sparingly. Think smartly about whether you need to link or whether you can make do with a good, old-fashioned quote or citation.  Don’t link just because you can. Second, link explicitly: Youtube.com is better than this. Third, realize that online content is dynamic. It makes no sense to link a dynamic resource when the intent is to create a link to a static version of a document. Tools like the Save Page Now service, hosted by the Internet Archive, do just that. You can find this essay at http://sprintbeyondthebook.com/2014/02/bad-links/ but its earlier draft is best captured in a snapshot here: http://web.archive.org/web/20140208220625/http://sprintbeyondthebook.com/2014/02/bad-links/. Finally, do not neglect the humble footnote. Footnotes provide a nice blend between usability, transparency, and good knowledge design.

Internet is not rhyzomatic. Mediation is at stake. " But the bottom line is that dumb-pipe email is unmediated, and therefore it's a business that Google wants to get out of as soon as it can."

" It's also why I believe Google will kill Gmail as soon as it comes up with a mediated alternative everyone loves. Of course, Google may offer an antiquated "Gmail view" as a semi-obscure alternative to the default "Inbox"-like mediated experience."

## New Humanism
"Neuroscience has put a new spin on free will and culpability: It "can help us see that all behavior is mechanical, that all behavior is produced by chains of physical events that ultimately reach back to forces beyond the agent’s control."

Post humanism as latent monism. What is the problem with monism? Two types of monism:
stuff monism and thing monism. Everything is made of the same matter (information). Everything is a part of the same thing, living organism. S

Humanism: Agency, Deliberation, Consensus, Dissent.

Technology, Complex Systems, in defense of Humanism
Post humanism. Complex systems. Neo platonism. A disempowering political program. If you think complex systems have emerging intelligence, they have the right to speak. There is something like intelligence, but there is a mode of intelligence that should be reserved for humans. Plain text offers that possibility. No amount of fancy theoretical footwork can obscure real inequalities that exist in the world today. Platform lock in. Global south. Mumford. Values cannot come from within systems. There has to be an outside, and the Kantian solution is to proceed as if there is an outside. That is a small space to remain human, all the more befuddling when that space is diminished by those professing in the humanities. Reading of Heidegger. Technology that answers to human values. 

My concern is with post-human ideology, that, in the name of forests, animals, and ecosystems, brings algorithms, markets, military bots, and manufactured goods into the sphere of ethics as actors. The agenda is one of determinism, which in its many guises has always been used as a mode of oppression, control, and to excuse violence.

Agency is a tiny and speculative bulwark against forces of determinism. We should not be too eager to dismantle it. In that light, poisoning oceans etc. can only make sense as a human relationship. Someone must be on that other shore! An ethics posited between a man and an ocean alone are dangerous and impossible. I'd site the lineage of good ole Kant, Marx, Sartre, and Arendt for that line of reasoning,

How to confront the foundational violence of humanism. Use non-European sources here as well.

Latent monism. Plotonius. Monism of the underlying matter (everything is made of one stuff, information) and monism of the universe is one: Dr. Bronner's monism.

### Hospital as an Archive

### Electronic Discovery

### Media Archeology
This is not a technological prolbem. Prolifiration of formats ensures a business of waste. Data must be stored in human readable formats both so we can study it AND to protect it. This is not just minimal computing for them, but a vision of computing for us. It is a political stance. The weight of .pdf vs. .txt. It is not a computational challenge. Digital dicay. The need to obviate media archeology. Data must be held in plain text.

### New Humanism
Humans as systems. But as recursive and self referential systems. The ability to incorporate models to alter behavior. Frustrates predicative models. Charles Goodhart "Goodhart's Law." and Robert Lucas. Lucas Critique. Pluralism.

"We recognize that separating humanity from nature, from the whole of life, leads to humankind’s own destruction and to the death of nations. Only through a re-integration of humanity into the whole of nature can our people be made stronger. That is the fundamental point of the biological tasks of our age. Humankind alone is no longer the focus of thought, but rather life as a whole . . . This striving toward connectedness with the totality of life, with nature itself, a nature into which we are born, this is the deepest meaning and the true essence of National Socialist thought.” – National Socialist professor of biology, Ernst Lehmann."

Opposed to monism. Dialogical and dialectical systems. Including dualism!

Monism. Haeckel, Ernst the Monist League (*Monistenbund*) as the founding of the Nazi Party. "The religion of the future" from Otto Herrmann's article. 

"Modern science and philosophy are revealing the world to us as a spiritual commonwealth, self-existing, self-governing and self directing." (Herrmann, 1913). The idea of ecology is not necessarily offensive. It is when it is turned into monism, one ecology in other words, is when it becomes fascism.

The ideas that systems are self directing. 

Christianity embracing dualism (strangely enough). I write this as a committed atheist.

"Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes"  Goodhart, Charles (1981). "Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience". Anthony S. Courakis (ed.), Inflation, Depression, and Economic Policy in the West (Rowman & Littlefield): 111–146

Campbell, Donald T., Assessing the Impact of Planned Social Change The Public Affairs Center, Dartmouth College, Hanover New Hampshire, USA. December, 1976.

"The more any quantitative social indicator (or even some qualitative indicator) is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor."

These sociologists are noticing a broader effect. Humans are recursive machines. We are able to reprogram ourselves in opposition to predicative model. We trade on the knowledge gap. Those who are modelled and those able to escape modeling. Sartre and negation. More than negation. A positive ability to incorporate model and to morph into new practices. Agency, deliberation, consensus, dissent. <-- this should be the last word of the book!

Minimalism. Plain

Elegant Variation, Fowler

If you've never interacted with your computer through a text-based terminal, understand for now that the command line is a sort of a call-and-response dialog between you and your system. This way of interacting with computers predates modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and is still commonly used by professional programmers and system administrators.

More than an interface, the command line encapsulates a phislosophy of computing: write simple programs that do one thing well.

This philosophy contrasts sharply with altertive vision: where "things just work," glossy visual interfaces. Surfaces and alienation. 

That computer interfaces entail politics is not an uncontriversial assumption and one which will become central to the argument of my book.

Despite the ubiquity of Unix-like systems (which run a lion share of servers, super-computers, Apple gadgets, and Android devices), the textual roots of computing are abscured by visual 

The battle for the soul of computing. Whether the internet empowers participatory governance, delibiration, and dissent, or whether it ushrs in a new era of mass surveilance and centralized control depends crucially on which of these two models of computing prevails.


## Security, access
Security, privacy. Surveillance. Openness. Secrecy. Part of the same coin. Crypto vs. open source movement.
Commands: crypto, pgp, chmod, groups, file permissions

Authorship is better thought of as access. How that is codified. Groups.

## Networking
Key terms: internet, rhizome, web, network, infrastructure, hardware, and software.
ping, traceroute, the terminal way: multiple users. personal vs. central computers

Internet is not a rhyzome. Central control. Surface vs. depth structures--twitter is rhyzomatic on the surface. 

Actor-networks. We are pushing ourselves through the wires. Hardware in control.
