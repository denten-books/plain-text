# Introduction
## Thesis, Audience
Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. A fundamental concept in the development of computing, plain text stands in opposition to closed platforms, rarefied knowledge, and black-box devices. Instead, it offers a vision of data that is human-readable by design: portable, concise, and universal. This book contains an argument for plain text, seeking to empower a community of students, scholars, authors, publishers, librarians, activists, and, generally, citizens interested in re-evaluating some of the ideas, tools, and practices that shape their daily encounter with computation.

The argument starts with foundational principles of media and literary studies and information science. I ask: what is at stake in the difference between digital and analog?  What contains more information a block of wood or a novel? How is text structured? What separates meaning, form, and formatting? Where does data end and meta-data begin? What does it mean to "have read a book" or to "know something"? To what extent is media the message? The formulation of these broadly philosophic concerns influences the more pragmatically-minded and applied discussion in the second half of the book. Thinking together about the nature of human-computer interfaces, knowledge as hardware and software, links, networking, inter-textuality, word processing, text encoding, and cryptography will allow us to approach issues of control and governance, access and cooperation, consensus and dissent, and privacy and surveillance.

A secondary aim of this volume is to convince the reader, especially one without much technical background, to view their computational environment as a literary system. I mean a "literary system" in opposition to what one might conventionally mistake for a "binary" or "digital" one, however imprecise those terms are in everyday use. And should I succeed, I ask the readers to apply the same critical acuity to reading code as they do to close-reading of prose and poetry. Admittedly, to treat computers as a literary system is an unusual proposition, but one that I hope to sustain on a firm basis, grounded in literary theory and in the history of modern computing. Detailed case studies from that history will point to (what I hope is an) unexpected confluence between the shared history of computing and literary thought. 

A parallel audience to the one composed of non-technical readers is one that shares expertise in computer science or electrical engineering, but also one that does not usually view its daily practice in its historical, philosophical, and political contexts. Designers, software engineers, project managers, and executives are often asked to make choices at work that have not only technological, but broader social and cultural implications. Choosing a text editor, a filing system, or a social networking platform cannot be adequately addressed in shallow instrumental terms like efficacy, speed, or performance. Such choices also affect deep structures of knowledge transmission, the formation of collective and institutional memories, the quality of online discussion, and the ways in which we relate to our family, friends, and colleagues. Ultimately, in the concluding chapters, this book is meant to challenge the widely-held (if often hidden) notion that systems can give rise to ethical or political values. Values, as I will argue, must be projected from without, by free-willing agents that can voluntarily deliberate, form consensus, and  articulate shared goals. The only sentient beings answering to these criteria are humans (and not, for example, cyborgs or complex systems). The book then is ultimately an articulation of a new humanism, which runs counter to the recent theoretical turn towards post- and trans- humanisms which elevate systems (natural and artificial) to the privileged position of ethical and political agents. 

## Theory and Method 
The book is a book, but it is also a tool. Readers will get much more out of it if they are able to actively follow along using their terminal emulator of choice. If these words mean nothing to you, rest assured that the text assumes no prior technical knowledge. It can be read sequentially as a conventional piece of scholarship in textual theory or "new media" studies. For those willing to take the plunge, I will often illustrate abstract theoretical concepts by asking the reader to type some commands into their terminals. Detailed instructions on how to set up this "augmented" reading environment, tutorials, and explanations can be found in the technical appendix and on the forthcoming companion website. 

Both novices and experts alike can benefit from exposure to ideas in the command line, on the level of the operating system. At the very least, the reader will walk way from this book with concepts and skills foundational to computing as critical thought and critical practice. But I hope that many readers will go beyond the basics, gaining deep-seated, intuitive, "hands-on" understanding of operational concepts like files, filing systems, networks, search tools, servers, and encryption technologies. Developing an intuitive understanding of systems that structure so much of our daily activity has the potential to radically transform one's experience with text, media, and digital devices. 

Unmoored theoretical concepts like "text" gain a palpable form when explored in the context of a specific platform. To put it another way: "text" ("media," "body," "information") in some very real ways exist only as their instantiation. That is to say that I do not believe that abstract categories like "text" and "media" can possibly be reduced to a number of essential, structural features that would manifest either as text or media. Rather, to borrow from a conversation on categories in Wittgenstein's *Philosophic Investigations*, categories denote a related "family" of practices, which may or may not share any given characteristic. Imagine instead a Venn diagram, where fields of textuality intersect and diverge in a historically (culturally, practically) contingent, arbitrary ways. This anti-essentialist streak brings Wittgenstein closer to pragmatists like William James, or, more appropriately, Frank Ramsey (a close friend and colleague of Wittgenstein), who would write that meaning "is to be defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would lead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and effects."[@ramsey-foundationsofmath p.155] In this way, my own definitions of key operational concepts in the field of literary and media theory hinge on pragmatic causes and effects. Throughout, I am compelled to ask "What is at stake?"


It is one thing, for example, to theorize about form and content, and it is quite another to see how form and content are encoded in .txt and .pdf formats and how these distinctions then affect material divisions of labor between "knowledge workers," "content producers," typesetting sweatshops, and international conglomerates that control vectors of literary distribution.

Something like a textbook in "applied media studies" or "theoretical digital humanities."

The logic of pragmatic literary theory, by definition, is necessarily a species of materialism, which looks to. A corrective to Marxist mataterialsm that views materialism as representation of such.

The methodological move from theory, to history, into practice follows a recent interest in the fields of philosophy, history, and literary studies in supplementing thought with a robust sense of doing and making. My own version of is embodied in the idea of "experimental methods." What does it mean to “experiment” in the study of history, literature, or philosophy? In answering that question I draw inspiration from two distinct spaces. First, the laboratory, where scientists bracket the world in search for independent variables and reproducible results. Second, the studio, where artists let the world in: to disrupt rigid modes of perception under circumstances that are always indeterminate and subjective.[^ln-cage] In both spaces, thought is secreted in practice, “on the fetid and throbbing ground of life.”[^ln-bernard][ln-xpmeth]

## Market Review
Affinities to science and technology studies, new media studies, platform studies, critical code studies, media archeology, computational culture studies. A group of media theorists discussing photography in the last few decades fail to grasp some fundamential truths about the medium divorced from the mechanics of CMOS censors, optics, and from the practice of editing images digitally in Photoshop. A conversation divorced from the material stratum of images and from the practice of photography is restricted to the surface image. It can deal only with the relationship of pixels on the screen (or dots on a page). In response to this line of critique, media studies as a field has been undergoing a practical turn from surface to materialty in practice.

Historical. 

Brings it closer to digital humanities, which is very material but often atheoretical. Theory in material and practice.

Only in this way can media studies answer the lofty goals of critique. There is no hope of reaching from the screen to the political consequences without grounding analyiss in practice. A critique in tradition of the Frankfurt school, requires furhter understanding of the economic reality of media, its legal and legilative context, issues of intellectual proprty and labor conditions. 

My approach to media theory attempts to make good on the promise. Where I often begin with philosophical

# Part I
## We Have Always Been Digital
Key terms: binary, digital, analog, plain text, surface, depth
Commands: pwd, ls, cd, cat, wc

In an ASCII-rendered plain text file, byte count corresponds to character count.[^ln-char] Let these words soak in for a moment. The rest of the book will be spent unpacking this idea. We will have to come to terms with what "plain text," "ASCII," and "bytes" really represent. But for now, a common-sense understanding of the sentiment will suffice. It is enough to have the intuition that texts and characters are concepts meant for humans and that bytes have something to do with (and for) machines. Remarkably, under the singular conditions of plain text (and even then, not always, and with many caveats), a unit of information meaningful to me (a human for the most part) gains a measure of equivalence to a byte, a unit of information meant for a computer (which is, however likable, still a machine).

[^ln-char]: There are many caveats here, to be explored later. Follow along with excercises related to the discussion in the Technical Appendix.

Recent theory challenges the conceptual boundaries between humans and machines in a concerted way. Perhaps, such boundaries were never that clearly articulated in the first place. It is also likely that other modalities of being are possible on the spectrum between human and machine, or human and complex system. We will have a chance to explore these possibilities in Part II of the book. For now, I ask that the reader simply rely on the colloquial, pre-theoretical understanding of both person and instrument. However intertwined the hand and the hammer can be, there is a way in which even a child can separate one from the other. There is a deep-rooted instinct at work in that distinction, one that cannot and should not be dismissed as mere naivete. The concept of a human is in itself a powerful theoretical construct, and, as I will argue later, one necessary, not only for the understanding of key concepts in computer science, but also in articulating an ethics and a politics of computation.

But before we can get there, we need to gain clarity on the key terms of the conversation. Too often anxiety about algorithmic thinking, data, and digitization is fueled by simplistic and downright misguided ideas about the underlying technologies. Part I of this book is dedicated to building a critical vocabulary that goes hand-in-hand with digital literacy. Those with an engineering background will be introduced to an intellectual history of ideas that guide practice. And those readers interested in "theory," will gain a measure of technical competency required for higher-level thinking (opinion-formation and decision-making) about the subject.

Digitality is first in a long series of these muddled terms. The original intuition, challenged by Nelson Goodman in the late sixties, still holds sway in the popular imagination. On this view, digitality has relates to digits, just as "analog" relates to analogies. First use of the word digital. The distinction between analog and metaphysical threat, Kittler and Golumbia.

### Text Plain and Fancy 

## Freedom and Information
Information is intentional. Against the "cybernatic" formal definitions. 

Information as entropy. The strangeness of Weaver's "information as entropy". How much information in a brick? In a novel? Information as a possibility.

Freedom and information seem to have nothing to do with each other. They have everything to do with each other.
Makukov. Directed pan-spermia.Life Sciences in Space Research paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5618 Icarus paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6739 

What is information? The difference that makes a difference. Bateson's definition. Dorsality. Weaver's entropy. Explain. Amount of freedom. Confusion in that paper. Noise and information seem to be the same! Thermodynamic explaination. Transmitting things in stone (low entropy) vs. transmitting them through the air (high entropy). Does a block of wood have more "information" than a novel? This definition cannot account for it really.

Extended cognition hypothesis. Get this text from disertation. The monism problem.

Formal vs. instrumental definitions. Information is that which moves form a Mind > Encoding > Mediation > Decoding > Transmision. Coersion. Can information be coersed? Both on the sending and the recieving end. Can someone admit something is music by force? Can you force information. The deer and the tick. The deer does not "send" bodyheat information. The tick receives information as it does receive the action of gravity. Does a mountain erode from the top because it recieves information from the outside? Information here is simply used as a synonym for some material state of the univrse and the causal relationship between forces. Causality alone is not information. Laws of physics are not information. Well, unless...

Mis information. Man in the middle attacks. Information is intentional. Mind to mind communication. Where does the thought originate? Freedom. Free intent. Identity of coding and decoding is not necessery. What is however necessary is the

Science lecture vs. humanities. Stuff that is known. Stuff that is not known

What does it really mean to "know" something? Or to have "read" a book? I have had the following conversation countless times. Someone asks, "Have you read Nabokov's *Pale Fire*," and I respond, "Yes I have." But there is a world of a difference between reading it yesterday, last week, or ten years ago. The book as an interface leaves an organic trace in the human mind--an imprint that begins to fade as soon as it is created.

How much knowledge is there in the world? According to a recent paper published in Science, 295 exabytes (or billion gigabytes).[@hilbert] 

Whatever consciousness is, it is propelled forward on a thin edge of material substratum. Reality exists only in the now, where the past is a memory and the future only a possibility. Imagine whispering something to a friend. It does not have to be very complicated, something like "I love you" or "I miss you." The whisper dissipates as soon it is uttered. The percussion of the speaker's breath creates temporary order: giving shape and pushing air molecules into waves of pattern and form. That order begins dissipating as soon as it is created. Within milliseconds, molecules return to their natural state of chaos.

To steel ourselves against entropy, we change the substratum from air to stone. It's molecules are more stable. Etched in stone will be the same message. It will last longer now. But it will also take longer to create. You will have to carry around your tablet and chisel. The message etched in stone will outlive the whisper and indeed will

The dream of a universal language. Lully. Leibniz with digital and logic. Boole with boolean logic. Shannon with the insight that boolean logic can be implemented in circuits. Finally, Turing, with his Unversal Turing Machine. Answer the following questions here:  How does Turing define the state of the machine? What is the equivalent of a "program" or "software" in the language of the paper? What is the difference between a Turing machine and a universal Turing machine? How is the state of the machine similar to a "state of mind?" What is the difference between what we understand as "software," "hardware," and "data" in Turing's language?

"Claude Shannon first explicitly posed the question of finding the smallest possible universal Turing machine in 1956. He showed that two symbols were sufficient so long as enough states were used (or vice-versa), and that it was always possible to exchange states by symbols." Get at this. States and symbols.

### The problem of duplicates
The conversation between Goodman and Genette. Goodman's "Art and Authenticity." Benjamin. Immanence and transcendence. Goodman: thinking about the perfect copy. But there is a confusion here: fake art is not necessarily about a copy, it is about provenance. Autographic vs. allographic art. Whether forgery is possible. Digital vs. analog art. Analog art is medium bound. Digital abstracts from the material.

Internet is not rhyzomatic. Mediation is at stake. " But the bottom line is that dumb-pipe email is unmediated, and therefore it's a business that Google wants to get out of as soon as it can."

" It's also why I believe Google will kill Gmail as soon as it comes up with a mediated alternative everyone loves. Of course, Google may offer an antiquated "Gmail view" as a semi-obscure alternative to the default "Inbox"-like mediated experience."

## New Humanism
"Neuroscience has put a new spin on free will and culpability: It "can help us see that all behavior is mechanical, that all behavior is produced by chains of physical events that ultimately reach back to forces beyond the agent’s control."

Post humanism as latent monism. What is the problem with monism? Two types of monism:
stuff monism and thing monism. Everything is made of the same matter (information). Everything is a part of the same thing, living organism. S

Humanism: Agency, Deliberation, Consensus, Dissent.

Technology, Complex Systems, in defense of Humanism
Post humanism. Complex systems. Neo platonism. A disempowering political program. If you think complex systems have emerging intelligence, they have the right to speak. There is something like intelligence, but there is a mode of intelligence that should be reserved for humans. Plain text offers that possibility. No amount of fancy theoretical footwork can obscure real inequalities that exist in the world today. Platform lock in. Global south. Mumford. Values cannot come from within systems. There has to be an outside, and the Kantian solution is to proceed as if there is an outside. That is a small space to remain human, all the more befuddling when that space is diminished by those professing in the humanities. Reading of Heidegger. Technology that answers to human values. 

My concern is with post-human ideology, that, in the name of forests, animals, and ecosystems, brings algorithms, markets, military bots, and manufactured goods into the sphere of ethics as actors. The agenda is one of determinism, which in its many guises has always been used as a mode of oppression, control, and to excuse violence.

Agency is a tiny and speculative bulwark against forces of determinism. We should not be too eager to dismantle it. In that light, poisoning oceans etc. can only make sense as a human relationship. Someone must be on that other shore! An ethics posited between a man and an ocean alone are dangerous and impossible. I'd site the lineage of good ole Kant, Marx, Sartre, and Arendt for that line of reasoning,

How to confront the foundational violence of humanism. Use non-European sources here as well.

Latent monism. Plotonius. Monism of the underlying matter (everything is made of one stuff, information) and monism of the universe is one: Dr. Bronner's monism.
### Hospital as an Archive
### Electronic Discovery
### Media Archeology
This is not a technological prolbem. Prolifiration of formats ensures a business of waste. Data must be stored in human readable formats both so we can study it AND to protect it. This is not just minimal computing for them, but a vision of computing for us. It is a political stance. The weight of .pdf vs. .txt. It is not a computational challenge. Digital dicay. The need to obviate media archeology. Data must be held in plain text.
### New Humanism
Humans as systems. But as recursive and self referential systems. The ability to incorporate models to alter behavior. Frustrates predicative models. Charles Goodhart "Goodhart's Law." and Robert Lucas. Lucas Critique. Pluralism.

"We recognize that separating humanity from nature, from the whole of life, leads to humankind’s own destruction and to the death of nations. Only through a re-integration of humanity into the whole of nature can our people be made stronger. That is the fundamental point of the biological tasks of our age. Humankind alone is no longer the focus of thought, but rather life as a whole . . . This striving toward connectedness with the totality of life, with nature itself, a nature into which we are born, this is the deepest meaning and the true essence of National Socialist thought.” – National Socialist professor of biology, Ernst Lehmann."

Opposed to monism. Dialogical and dialectical systems. Including dualism!

Monism. Haeckel, Ernst the Monist League (*Monistenbund*) as the founding of the Nazi Party. "The religion of the future" from Otto Herrmann's article. 

"Modern science and philosophy are revealing the world to us as a spiritual commonwealth, self-existing, self-governing and self directing." (Herrmann, 1913). The idea of ecology is not necessarily offensive. It is when it is turned into monism, one ecology in other words, is when it becomes fascism.

The ideas that systems are self directing. 

Christianity embracing dualism (strangely enough). I write this as a committed atheist.

"Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes"  Goodhart, Charles (1981). "Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience". Anthony S. Courakis (ed.), Inflation, Depression, and Economic Policy in the West (Rowman & Littlefield): 111–146

Campbell, Donald T., Assessing the Impact of Planned Social Change The Public Affairs Center, Dartmouth College, Hanover New Hampshire, USA. December, 1976.

"The more any quantitative social indicator (or even some qualitative indicator) is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor."

These sociologists are noticing a broader effect. Humans are recursive machines. We are able to reprogram ourselves in opposition to predicative model. We trade on the knowledge gap. Those who are modelled and those able to escape modeling. Sartre and negation. More than negation. A positive ability to incorporate model and to morph into new practices. Agency, deliberation, consensus, dissent. <-- this should be the last word of the book!

Elegant Variation, Fowler

If you've never interacted with your computer through a text-based terminal, understand for now that the command line is a sort of a call-and-response dialog between you and your system. This way of interacting with computers predates modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and is still commonly used by professional programmers and system administrators.

More than an interface, the command line encapsulates a phislosophy of computing: write simple programs that do one thing well.

This philosophy contrasts sharply with altertive vision: where "things just work," glossy visual interfaces. Surfaces and alienation. 

That computer interfaces entail politics is not an uncontriversial assumption and one which will become central to the argument of my book.
